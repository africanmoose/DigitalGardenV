### Quotes
> In his final prescription for America, Dr. Vivek Murthy delivers a profound truth: **[well-being is relational, not just personal](https://superage.cmail20.com/t/y-l-cttitdt-hjtkjjltlh-k/)**. Backed by decades of research, Murthy outlines what he calls the _Triad of Fulfillment_—relationships, purpose, and service. Connection, he argues, is as vital to our health and longevity as diet, exercise, and sleep.  
  
> At the heart of the triad is love—not the fleeting sentimentality often associated with the word, but a commanding force with the power to build, strengthen, and heal. **It’s the thread that weaves together communities capable of nurturing fulfillment and belonging**. Love, extended not only to family and friends but also to colleagues, strangers, and even adversaries, is the foundation of the triad.  
  
> **The Triad of Fulfillment**

> 1. **Relationships:** With whom can I connect more deeply?
> 2. **Service:** What can I do to help others? 
> 3. **Purpose:** What gives my life meaning?
    
> When combined with the core virtues of love, kindness, grace, hope, generosity, and courage, these three elements create an ecosystem for meaning and belonging.  
  
> **Invest in Your Triad of Fulfillment This Week**

>Deepen a Connection – Call someone you’ve been meaning to catch up with or invite a friend for a walk.

> Clarify Your Purpose – Write down three things that give your life meaning and one action you can take this week to strengthen them.

> Serve in Small Ways – Check in on a neighbor or volunteer your time—even a few minutes of kindness has measurable health benefits.
