Not in any particular order....

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Einstein - His Life and Universe - Walter Isaacson\|Einstein - His Life and Universe - Walter Isaacson]]

This biography is quite long and detailed, and it took me a while to get through it. It gave me a new appreciation for Einsteins leap of scientific imagination and love of trying to understand the world around him.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Slow productivity - Cal Newport\|Slow productivity - Cal Newport]]

I always like Cal Newport, and he gives solid reasons to focus on quality and working slow in producing good work.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Never eat alone - Keith Ferrazzi\|Never eat alone - Keith Ferrazzi]]

This book was mind-opening. Much has to do with how to network professionally, but not in a cut-throat winner-takes-all manner, but with kindness and love for others.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/The Great Mental Models Volume 2 - Physics, Chemistry and Biology\|The Great Mental Models Volume 2 - Physics, Chemistry and Biology]]

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/The Great Mental Models Volume 3 - Systems and Mathematics\|The Great Mental Models Volume 3 - Systems and Mathematics]]

Shane Parrish has always been one of my favorite authors. His data to noise signal is exceedingly high. I always learn something when I read his work. 

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/All About Love - New Visions - bell hooks\|All About Love - New Visions - bell hooks]]

Bell Hooks is a generational thinker. This book has made me, and will continue to make me think deeply on my own relationships and how i can do better. When we are loving we openly and honestly express care, affection, responsibility, respect, commitment, and trust.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Co-Intelligence - Living and Working with AI - Ethan Mollick\|Co-Intelligence - Living and Working with AI - Ethan Mollick]]

AI seems to be taking over the world. This book offers a clear understanding of how AI systems work, and practical ways to benefit from them without falling into the pitfalls of AI use.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/The Art of Frugal Hedonism - A Guide to Spending Less While Enjoying Everything More - Annie Raser-Rowland, Adam Grubb\|The Art of Frugal Hedonism - A Guide to Spending Less While Enjoying Everything More - Annie Raser-Rowland, Adam Grubb]]

Save money and enjoy life more? I am sold. Ideas on how to be frugal but at the same time enjoy life and appreciate the things we have.

### The Princess Bride - William Goldman

One of my favorite movies of all time, and this was the first time I read the book. As brilliant as the movie was, the book is better.

### The Illustrated Man - Ray Bradbury

Ray Bradbury's writing is brilliant, creepy, thought-provoking and full of suspense.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/The Wisdom of the Bullfrog - William H. McRaven\|The Wisdom of the Bullfrog - William H. McRaven]]

Admiral McRaven, former US Navy, writes about leadership and general life wisdom. I read this book, and then my book reader died and I lost my notes. It was so good that I ended up reading it again to process all the great points that he makes. 

### Peak: The Science of Expertise - Anders Ericsson

I haven't finished processing this book fully yet, but Peak and Thinking in Bets are two books that will hugely influence my 2026. Ericsson clearly shows how to build expertise in a field. Any field.

### Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When you Don't Have all the Facts - Annie Duke

I haven't finished processing this book fully yet, but Peak and Thinking in Bets are two books that will hugely influence my 2026. Life is more like Poker than Chess. No one knows what cards you might get, there is an element of chance involved, but you can learn and improve on your decision making.
