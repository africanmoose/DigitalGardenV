### Quotes
> Because our gardens are a part of nature, they never look exactly the same twice. Start by listening to the voices of the vegetation around you. Notice how the voice within you responds. Your garden is a place where your body and soul can be in dialogue with your surroundings. Gardening tools can rust easily, so you should treat them with care. As we have seen, if you donâ€™t keep your tools in proper working condition, they will become less and less effective, and the risk of injury will be increased. After every use you should clean the dirt off them, then give them a once-over with a grindstone. Be sure they are fully dry before putting them away. If you do this, your tools will always be in tip-top condition when you need them.
