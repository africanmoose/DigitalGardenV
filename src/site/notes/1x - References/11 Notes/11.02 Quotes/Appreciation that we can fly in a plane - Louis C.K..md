## Quote
“Everybody on every plane should just constantly be going ‘Oh my God, wow!’ You’re flying. You’re … you’re sitting in a chair in the sky! But ‘It doesn’t go back a lot’. And ‘It smells really’. You know, here’s the thing: people say there’s delays on flights. Delays. Really? New York to California in five hours. That used to take thirty years to do that, and a bunch of you would die on the way there, and have a baby. You’d be with a whole different group of people by the time you got there. Now you watch a movie, you take a dump, and you’re home.”
