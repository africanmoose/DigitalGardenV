### Quotes
> When I tell my team that they should try to “work themselves out of a job,” what I really mean is that I want them to document and optimize their responsibilities so well that someone else can easily come in to take over their role—allowing them to move up within the company, taking on more responsibilities and creating more value. If someone is able to show me that they’ve documented their processes, searched for time-saving optimizations, and set up systems to cover their core responsibilities on autopilot, that shows me that person is ready to take on bigger and better things. Not only are they bright enough to make these improvements, but they’ve shown that they’re committed to making the organization better by saving time and money. I want to work closely with those people, and I would expect that most leaders and managers would feel the same way. It may sound counterintuitive, but working yourself out of a job is the best way to move up in an organization or within your career. I suspect this might be scary to an employee at first, but if they were to think about getting promoted to the next level, they know that someone will need to replace them.
