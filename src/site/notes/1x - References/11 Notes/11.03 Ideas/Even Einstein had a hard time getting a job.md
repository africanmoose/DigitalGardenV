### Quotes
> Both in Zurich and then in Milan, Einstein churned out job-seeking letters, ever more pleading, to professors around Europe. They were accompanied by his paper on the capillary effect, which proved not particularly impressive, he rarely even received teh courtesy of a response. "I will soon have graced every physicist from the Norht Sea to the southern tip of Italy with my offer," he wrote Maric.

> "I leave no stone unturned and do not give up my sense of humor," he wrote his friend Marcel Grossmann. "God created the donkey and gave him a thick skin"
