• Incomplete information
• Uncertainty
• Randomness
• Chance
• Unfortunate timing
• Poor incentives
>
> With assets priced high and no room for error, markets would be hanging on by a thread, crushed at the first sniff of anything less than perfection.
> The irony is that when markets are guaranteed not to crash—or more realistically, when people think that’s the case—they are far more likely to crash.
> The mere idea of stability causes a smart and rational movement toward bidding asset prices up high enough to cause instability.
> Stability is destabilizing.
>Or, put another way: Calm plants the seeds of crazy. Always has, always will.
