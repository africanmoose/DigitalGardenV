### Summary
- A great summary of how to keep your Zettelkasten on electronic media.

### How I discovered it
- I searched for any books that have to do with Zettelkastents.

### How the book changed me
- I was already using ZK electronically, with many of the same tools that Kadavy recommends so not much change in this case.

### Details
- [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.03 Ideas/Notes should be for jogging memory not substituting memory\|Notes should be for jogging memory not substituting memory]]
- [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.03 Ideas/The iceberg principle - dont share everything you know\|The iceberg principle - dont share everything you know]]
- Much of the information covered in this book I have already documented here [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.03 Ideas/Zettelkasten Method\|Zettelkasten Method]] and here [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.06 Structure Notes/Zettelkasten Principles\|Zettelkasten Principles]] so I am not going to repeat it in this review.
