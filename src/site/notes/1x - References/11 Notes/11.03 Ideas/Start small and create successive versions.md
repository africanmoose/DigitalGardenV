### Summary
- If you want to do something large and complex, start small and make successive versions, improving with each version.

### Details
- Successive versioning allows you to evolve based on response and feedback
- It also makes it easier to get started
- An alternative is detailed planning, but when planning ahead in detail we can not pivot easily when we learn something in a particular iteration

### Quotes
> How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned.
> 
> It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're making something for people — to get an initial version in front of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.
> 
> Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work. Surprisingly often, it does. If it doesn't, this will at least get you started. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-190c6c53ae0#445e2c09-cb57-432b-962c-7e1ed7f51cd0)

> The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it is to plan in advance what you're going to do. And planning does usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized to say "we're going to do x and then y and then z" than "we're going to try x and see what happens." And it is more _organized_; it just doesn't work as well.
> 
> Planning per se isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something you have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.
