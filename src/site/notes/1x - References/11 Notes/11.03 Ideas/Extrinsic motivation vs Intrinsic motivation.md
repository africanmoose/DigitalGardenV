### Quotes
This was a theme that had fascinated him since the verybeginning of his career. Just one year after completing his PhD at Carnegie Mellon University in 1970, he published an influential paper in which he asked people to solve a puzzle called the Soma cube (a little like a Rubik’s Cube). He found that those who were offered a financial reward for solving the puzzle were, weirdly, less likely to enjoy the task and were more likely to give up solving the puzzle after the reward was removed, compared to those who weren’t offered any money at all.

Until that point, most scientists had thought that motivation was
mainly driven by incentives like rewards and punishments. But Deci and Ryan showed otherwise. They encouraged readers to see motivation falling on a spectrum,
with ‘extrinsic’ at one end and ‘intrinsic’ at the other. Intrinsic motivation comes from the inside: driven by self-fulfilment, curiosity and a genuine desire to learn. Extrinsic motivation comes from the outside: driven by pay-rises, material rewards and social approval. But these forms of motivation were not equal. According to selfdetermination theory, intrinsic motivation is substantially more powerful than extrinsic motivation. Lasting motivation comes from within
