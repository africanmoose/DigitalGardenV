### Summary
- Psychologiest Albert Bandura posited that our sense of self-efficacy (our sense of whether we are in control of our own lives) provides motivation and well being to ourselves.
### Details
- Self-efficacy is built by having experience of a job, watching other people doing a job, what people say and act towards us (encouragement) and our own state of emotions
- If we try to do something difficult, and overcome obstacles and achieve it, it gives us a high sense of self-efficacy
- Observing others accomplishing something also gives us the confidence that we too can do it.
- Positive verbal feedback builds self-efficacy, even things we ourselves say can have an effect on our own sense of self-efficacy

### Quotes
In the years after he introduced his revolutionary idea, Bandura would go on to identify a few simple tools that can have a transformative impact on self-efficacy. Take the power of verbal persuasion. Bandura was fond of pointing out a simple truth about self-efficacy: that the things you say often become the things you believe. As such, the very act of hearing small positive interventions, like ‘You can do it!’ or ‘Nearly there!’, can have a remarkable effect on our self-confidence levels
