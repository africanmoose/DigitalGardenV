### Quotes
> Stop asking how you can add valueâ€”that's just creating work for others. Spend some time figuring it out, then go do it. Observe your boss, figure out what they hate doing, learn to do it, and take it off their plate. It's an easy way to add value, put up a win, and build momentum. In the long run, the highest net value creator usually wins.
