### Quotes
> A paper mill went up in Baghdad in 795. Within several hundred years, a preeminent theological school in the city had amassed a collection of some 140,000 books. Nothing in Europe could come close to that achievement. Meanwhile, in eleventh-century Cairo, one mosque library boasted a collection of 200,000 books, and just a century later a royal library in the same city housed eight times that number in a massive structure consisting of some forty rooms—1.6 million books. Nor was it just a few locales. Libraries worth bragging about were popping up all over Muslim-held territory, supported by heavy investment and endless reams of paper; to show just how deep the connection goes, we get the word ream from the Arabic word for bundle: rizmah.
