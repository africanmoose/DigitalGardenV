### Summary
- When we are trying to achieve a goal, and experience a minor setback, we may say, in effect, 'what the hell?' and give up and end up with a large setback

### Details
- For example, we slip up in a diet, and then spiral and eat a whole pie.

### Quotes
> Research on the aptly named “what-the-hell effect” has demonstrated that even small failures, such as missing a daily diet goal by a few calories, can lead to downward spirals in behavior—such as eating a whole apple pie. This will sound familiar if you’ve ever given in to temptation in the morning (say, grabbing a proffered donut at a breakfast meeting) and then, having slipped up once, decided “What the hell. I already goofed, so all bets are off.” A minor mistake can tank your confidence, making you believe you’ll never succeed. Unfortunately, the more ambitious your goals, the higher the risk of a small but ultimately devastating failure.
