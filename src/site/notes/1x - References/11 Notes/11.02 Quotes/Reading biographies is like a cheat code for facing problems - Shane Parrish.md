## Quote
When you consistently read biographies, something interesting happens.

Life keeps throwing the same situations at you that you've read about in books. Only now you've seen what worked and what didn't.

Reading gives you pattern recognition for problems you haven't faced yet.

Having someone who solved the same problem you're facing whispering the answer in your ear is basically a cheat code.
