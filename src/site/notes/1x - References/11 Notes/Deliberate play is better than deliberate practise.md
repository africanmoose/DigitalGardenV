### Quotes
- Deliberate play is a structured activity that’s designed to make skill development enjoyable. It blends elements of deliberate practice and free play. Like free play, deliberate play is fun, but it’s structured for learning and mastery along with recreation. It’s built to break complex tasks into simpler parts so you can hone a specific skill. When I asked Evelyn Glennie how she practices, she said she spends nearly all her time in deliberate play. When she gets bored, she switches instruments, gracefully bouncing back and forth between different percussion tools. “If I’m trying to stay interested in a new marimba skill, I’ll transfer it to a drum kit,” she tells me. Mixing it up breaks up the monotony and keeps her passion in harmony. “There is absolutely no routine,” she says, laughing. “That spells hostage to me.” Deliberate play often involves introducing novelty and variety into practice. That can be in the ways you learn, the tools you use, the goals you set, and the people with whom you interact. Depending on the skill you’re trying to build, deliberate play might take the form of a game, a role-play, or an improvisational exercise.
