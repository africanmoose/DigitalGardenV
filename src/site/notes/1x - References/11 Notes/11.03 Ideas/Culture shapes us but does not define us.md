### Summary
- Culture or upbringing shapes us, but does not define everything about us

### Details
- When thinking about people, acknowledge their culture or background, but do not use it to classify people as each person has their own unique viewpoint and knowledge

### Quotes
> Hurston defied the lazy way people today classify others according to their group. Today, in our identity politics world, we are constantly reducing people to their categories: Black/white, gay/straight, Republican/Democrat. It’s a first-class way to dehumanize others and not see individuals. But Hurston, through her example, shows us what the true task of opening your eyes to others involves: How do I see a person as part of their group? And how, at the same time, do I see them as a never-to-be-repeated unique individual, bringing their own unique mind and viewpoint?

> If I tried to see a person like Zora Neal Hurston without seeing Black culture, that would be ridiculous. But if I saw her only as a Black person, that would also be ridiculous.

> And you have to manage both these things at a level of high complexity. One of the great fallacies of life is to think culture is everything; another great fallacy is to think culture is nothing. I’ve found it helpful to start with the idea that each of us exists in a state of givenness. Each of us can say, “I am the receiver of gifts. I am part of a long procession of humanity and I have received much from those who came before.” But people are not passive vessels into which culture is poured; each person is a cultural co-creator, embracing some bits of their culture, rejecting others—taking the stories of the past and transforming them with their own lives. To see a person well, you have to see them as culture inheritors and as culture creators.
