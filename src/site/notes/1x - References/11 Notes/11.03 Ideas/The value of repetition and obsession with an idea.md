### Summary
- Sometimes when you have an idea it needs to be repeated over and over again to refine it and improve it

### Details
- Da Vinci did this by repeating ideas and refining them in his notebooks over and over again
- Sometime it could be verbal - repeating an idea and discussing it with many people to refine it, as one friend of mine used to do
- Sometimes it could be art: repeat drawing the same thing and you will improve.

### Quotes
> Obsessive repetition and variation: when Leonardo developed an interest, he would gnaw away at it for years whether it seemed useful or not. So Pacioli might have seen two hundred pictures of convex mirrors; thousands of geometrical diagrams; five hundred illustrations of flying machines, insects, and birds; a hundred-odd plans for devices that could divert, lift or pump water. This persistence was one of Leonardo’s most vital attributes, and it could be playful too – how else to explain the scores of sketches of old men with distinctive ‘nutcracker’ profiles, their chins approaching their noses, who pop up at regular intervals? These seem to have been recreational drawings, Leonardo having fun on the page.
