### Summary

### Quotes
But what if people hate it? Good. The distance between love and hate is a lot shorter than the gulf between apathy and passion. If they hate your stuff, if your message rubs them the wrong way, at least they care about you and your idea. Breaking through from indifference to attention is more than half the battle
