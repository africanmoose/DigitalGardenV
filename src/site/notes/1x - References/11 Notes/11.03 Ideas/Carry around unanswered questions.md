### Quotes 
> Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around with you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the same.
> 
> Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before — in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about. People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful questions alive.\[[19](#f19n)\] [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-190c6c53ae0#46c5e77c-0b4d-4007-8720-613d3bdc05ab)

> It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start lots of small things.
- Paul Graham

> Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. **You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state.** Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: ‘_How did he do it? He must be a genius!’_
