### Quotes
> We have a practice called uchimizu wherein we sprinkle water on to a street or path, cooling down the area as well as damping down dust and other particulates. Uchimizu was originally practised at Shinto shrines.
> If you know what time your family member or loved one is coming home, why not give uchimizu a try? It is a way to express gratitude that the person has come home safely, and to instil happiness in them with the thought that someone has been awaiting their arrival.
> Even those of us living in a block of flats can do this. Think of the walk leading up to your front door as your sando. Showing respect to all those who share this path is sure to send ripples of gratitude through your neighbourhood and your community.
