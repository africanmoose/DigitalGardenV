In a large basin mix all dry ingredients. Use hands to break lumps in sugar and milk.

In a separate large bowl, mix liquid ingredients. Add to dry ingredients. Mix thoroughly, first with a wooden spoon, then with hands.

When mixed, divide onto baking sheets. A thin layer, no higher than edge of tray. 

Bake 300° 25-35 min.

At 15 min., stir each tray. Continue baking. When cool, add raisins.

While granola is baking, put raisins in a perforated pan used in convection oven. Place that pan in a deeper solid pan. Put in convection oven at 15 min. on heat and steam.
