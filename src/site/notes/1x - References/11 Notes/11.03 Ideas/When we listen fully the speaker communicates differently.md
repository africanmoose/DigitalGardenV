### Summary
- When a listener is fully present, the speaker will often change how they communicate.

### Details
- Most people today do not listen fully.
- Sometimes we are distracted by outside things
- Sometimes we are thinking of what to say next, or how to defend our position, or waht we like or whether we trust teh speaker or not.
- In one study, when listeners were positive and engaged, the story teller increased their creativity by adding their own interpretation onto the story

### Quotes
> Using tilts, nods, eyebrow raises, savor smiles, touches, and mirroring creates a halo effect around you

> Researchers from the University of Amsterdam had participants watch a short film and then describe it to research assistants. Half summarized the film to a positive listener—someone who smiled and nodded and had more open body language. The other half told their story to someone who exhibited a negative listening style: the person frowned more, slumped, and gave no positive head movement.

> The participants with the positive listeners not only described the film differently but actually thought about it more creatively. They described characters’ thoughts and emotions and included more of their own opinions about the film’s deeper meaning. People with the negative listeners focused solely on facts and concrete details
