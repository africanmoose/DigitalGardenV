### Summary
- Continuation of [[4x - Reading/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/The Great Mental Models Vol 1 - Shane Parrish\|The Great Mental Models Vol 1 - Shane Parrish]]. This one covers Physics, Chemistry and Biology and how these principles apply in real life

### How I discovered it

### How the book changed me
- I never thought of applying lessons and principles from sciences to real life. But they are really practical.
