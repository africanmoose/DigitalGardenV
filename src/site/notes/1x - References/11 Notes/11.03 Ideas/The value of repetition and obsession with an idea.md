### Summary
- Sometimes when you have an idea it needs to be repeated over and over again to refine it and improve it

### Details
- [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.05 Persons/Leonardo da Vinci\|Leonardo da Vinci]] did this by repeating ideas and refining them in his notebooks over and over again
- Sometime it could be verbal - repeating an idea and discussing it with many people to refine it, as one friend of mine used to do
- Sometimes it could be art: repeat drawing the same thing and you will improve.

### Quotes
> Obsessive repetition and variation: when Leonardo developed an interest, he would gnaw away at it for years whether it seemed useful or not. So Pacioli might have seen two hundred pictures of convex mirrors; thousands of geometrical diagrams; five hundred illustrations of flying machines, insects, and birds; a hundred-odd plans for devices that could divert, lift or pump water. This persistence was one of Leonardo’s most vital attributes, and it could be playful too – how else to explain the scores of sketches of old men with distinctive ‘nutcracker’ profiles, their chins approaching their noses, who pop up at regular intervals? These seem to have been recreational drawings, Leonardo having fun on the page.
> Looking at the human body, he puzzled out the mysterious workings of the vital aortic valve, four hundred years before anyone else; he was the first person to objectively describe the roots of the teeth; and he was the only person before Frederik Ruysch, two hundred years later, to make casts of organs. His experiments on the nervous system of frogs and dogs would not be repeated before Alexander Stuart in 1739, and his analysis of muscle groups in the 1490s foreshadows the twentieth-century science of ergonomics. Looking at whale-bone fossils emerging from Tuscan hillsides, he more or less invented the science of ichnology, which would not be pursued again before the 1820s, and his correct deduction that those hillsides had once been sea bed anticipated James Hutton’s Theory of the Earth, published in 1785. His description of impetus strikes us with its similarity to Newton’s first law of motion, published in 1687. One hundred and fifty years before Christiaan Huygens, he demonstrated the diffraction of waves passing through an aperture: he had deduced, as Huygens would, that light travelled in waves. His experimental discovery that the friction between two surfaces is independent of the area of contact matched the laws of friction worked out by Guillaume Amontons in 1699. Ball bearings matching his design would not come into use until the 1800s. He came up with an anti-friction metallic alloy strikingly similar to the first to be patented, Isaac Babbitt’s of 1839. He pursued aerodynamics, fluid dynamics and mechanics at levels that would not be matched for a hundred years or more. And although he definitely didn’t ‘invent the helicopter’, he did design machines, probably for the theatre, which would have generated some lift.26
