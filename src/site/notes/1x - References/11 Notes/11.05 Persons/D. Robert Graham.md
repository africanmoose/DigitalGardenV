### Quotes
> We are all familiar with politicians dropping in on a factory, hospital or building site as a backdrop for a policy announcement or as an appeal to the electorate. The fluorescent hi-vis vest and hard hat is often the uniform of candidates and lawmakers who have little experience of – or sympathy with – those people who wear them day in and day out. So when in 1977 D. Robert Graham, languishing at 1 per cent in polls to become governor of Florida, adopted workplace visits as the basis of his campaign, he knew he would face a sceptical reception. His response: full commitment. Instead of turning up at midday for a flying visit in the company of journalists, he would clock on when the regular workforce did. Instead of merely striking an industrious pose for the camera, he would work the whole day. And although the press pack would have to come along – he was trying to get elected, after all – he resolved to despatch them rapidly so he could spend as much time as possible on the job, learning from his temporary co-workers. All this his campaign team could understand. But the scale of Graham’s project took them aback. He resolved to work no fewer than one hundred full days in one hundred Florida workplaces in the year-and-a-half before polling day. This, his aides protested, was going too far.

> But he did it. He hefted sacks of fertiliser, he manned a shrimp boat, he taught twelfth-grade civics, he even searched the crime scene when the patrol car he was riding in arrived at a fatal shooting. He carried bags at the Orlando Sheraton, bussed tables in Little Havana and delivered parcels in Miami. The only job he turned down was as a strip-club wardrobe assistant. And it seemed to work. The press loved it, and they followed him with growing respect around classrooms, crab boats and paper mills. Nine months later, 1 percent had become 8. Graham, who by now had dropped the D. Robert and went by Bob, carried on: gutting mullet, fixing Toyotas, trucking tangerines, and eventually winning the Democratic party primary. The Miami Herald called him ‘a rich man who doesn’t mind working his tail off under a broiling sun to better understand the problems of Florida’s working men and women’, and greeted the news of his election to governor with the headline ‘Graham Lands 101st Job’.

> The constant note-taking brought organisational benefits: Graham’s staff members testified that they did ‘immeasurable’ good in ‘jogging the office memory’, and the notebooks yielded ‘literally hundreds’ of ideas to pursue. Whenever Graham went on a workday, a meet-and-greet or a campaign trail stop, he would pass the current notebook to everyone he spoke to, asking them to write their name and address in it. Thousands did so over the years and everyone whose name Graham took away with him would receive a personal letter from him a few days later, expressing his happiness at having met them. There’s an echo of the Renaissance album amicorum in this habit, and one senses that it sometimes gave Graham (or his staff) a chance to exercise their ironical skills: ‘I enjoyed seeing you at the Orlando Airport March 21,’ one 1987 letter read. ‘Thank you for the material which you gave me on Jehovah’s Witnesses and mankind’s future. I appreciate having this very enlightening information.’ That was one of fifty-one letters sent to people he had met that day.
