### Quotes
> In his book An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, Chris Hadfield* explains how and why astronauts learn as much as they can. They don’t stop at what they need to know but continue lifelong learning to prepare for any eventuality they can think of. They reduce blind spots. He says of astronauts that “no matter how competent or seasoned, every astronaut is a perpetual student.”4 They are “trained to look on the dark side and imagine the worst things that could possibly happen.”5 And then they train for them. Hadfield describes hours in simulators and classrooms, constantly training and preparing for an incredibly vast array of potential scenarios.

> After decades in the space program, Hadfield offers this perspective on life: “If you’ve got the time, use it to get ready.…Yes, maybe you’ll learn how to do a few things you’ll never wind up actually needing to do, but that’s a much better problem to have than needing to do something and having no clue where to start.”12

> After all, “when the stakes are high, preparation is everything.”13 The more you know, the more you will be able to anticipate and avoid problems. Knowledge then can be conceptualized as a margin of safety, a buffer against the inevitable unexpected challenges that you will have to face.
