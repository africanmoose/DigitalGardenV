### Quotes
> “When I tell others about my work, am I simply listing all of the things I’ve done in my role? Or am I intentionally highlighting what I want to do more of and want to be known for?” You want to bring visibility to your promotable work—meaning work that (1) is central to the strategic direction of your team or company, (2) puts you in the path of key stakeholders, including upper management or external clients, and (3) has potential to impact the company’s bottom line. If you continually bring attention to time-consuming tasks that don’t excite you or emphasize responsibilities that don’t mesh with your career goals, then you could find yourself pigeonholed into a career you don’t want or work you dislike.
