## Quote
"Running one mile has more in common with running a marathon than sitting at home.

Investing $100 has more in common with being a millionaire than being broke.

Writing one sentence has more in common with writing a book than never writing one.

It always feels small in the beginning and the big goals seem far away. It's easy to talk yourself out of the early attempts because they feel kind of meaningless.

But every race starts with one step. Every fortune starts with a small deposit. Every book begins as one sentence.

The real question is not "What is my current position?" but rather, "What is my current trajectory?" Doing nothing builds nothing. Put yourself on the path to something better. Start small, but make sure you start."*
