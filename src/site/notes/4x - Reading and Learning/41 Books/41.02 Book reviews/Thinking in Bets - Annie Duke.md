### Summary
- Annie Duke was a prize winning poker player, but also a psychologist. She writes about how to use a poker player mentality when making life decisions

### How I discovered it
- Recommended by Art of Manliness

### How the book changed me
- One important principle i learned is not to judge the quality of decisions by the outcome. 
- A second principle is to stop feeling sorry for myself, blaming 'luck' and examining how to improve your odds next time around.
