### Quotes
>  Elegance is simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness. It’s not only a solution that gets a result. It’s arguably a better solution—the least complex and clearest way forward. An elegant strategy offers leverage in service of the change we seek. While it might seem effortless in execution, creating the method requires insight and care.

> Elegant paths often seem roundabout at first, but they put systems to work for us, instead of against us. They require intent and discipline, and reward us with resilience and efficiency.
