### Summary
- Theodor Geisel, otherwise known as doctor Seuss, wrote The Cat in the Hat in response to a challenge from his publisher to write a book with just a 200 word vocabulary for young readers

### Details
- At the time, early readers were like 'Dick and Jane', exceedingly boring
- Later, his publisher bet him that he could not write a book using just 50 words, and he produced in 1960 'Green Eggs and Ham', a book that was his most successful ever.

### Quotes
On the contrary, if there is somebody whose work could never be called boring, it was Theodor Geisel, better known to children and former children around the globe as Dr. Seuss. Through more than half a billion copies of his sixty-plus books, he has likely shaped more young minds than just about anybody in history. He was the first author I ever read, and the odds are pretty good it might be the same for you. Fed up with Dick and Jane, as well as other dull early reader primers of the day, Seuss’s publisher challenged him to write “a story that first-graders can’t put down!” The prolific author accepted, and to push it a step further, he gave himself a constraint—limit the vocabulary to just a list of a couple hundred words important to those young readers. It wasn’t easy. Seuss sweated it out for a year and a half.

Eventually, he developed an iconic story of chaos, authority, and mischief that clocked in at a measly 236 different words. A complete departure from the polished suburban dreamscape home of Dick and Jane, the instantly loved The Cat in the Hat was born. Shortly after that release, Seuss doubled down. His publisher bet him fifty dollars that he could not write a book using just fifty words from that same list. It was a bad bet. After toiling away for another year, in 1960 Seuss published the equally zany Green Eggs and Ham, his most successful title ever, weighing in right at that total word count.
