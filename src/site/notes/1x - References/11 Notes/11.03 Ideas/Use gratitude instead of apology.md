### Quotes
> She swapped apology for gratitude. Instead of “I’m so sorry I can’t accommodate this,” she’d say, “Thanks for thinking of me. I’m glad I came to mind for this task.” After delivering her boundary, Simone allowed her boss to consider her words before jumping in to fill the space with unnecessary backtracking like “Don’t worry—if speaking with the client is an issue, then I’ll just find the time to handle this.”
