## Quote
"Fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm fearsome, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore. They leave that wisdom to those to whom it appeals. When the storm comes — when night falls — what's worse: the danger or the fear of danger? Give me reality, the danger itself."

## Author
Vincent van Gogh
