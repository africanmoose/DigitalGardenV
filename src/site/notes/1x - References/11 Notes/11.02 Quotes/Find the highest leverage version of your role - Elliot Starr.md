## Quote
Find the highest leverage version of your role. Skills like empathy, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, communication, and complex multi-disciplinary problem-solving are hard for AI to replicate. As are genuinely big-picture creative ideas, management, and mentorship. So, foster a culture of creativity.
