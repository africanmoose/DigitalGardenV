### Quotes
What you do on your bad days matters more than what you do on your good days.

Anyone can nourish their most important relationships when life is smooth, but the effort you put in during the rough patches matters more. When you're motivated, eating healthy is easy, but your choices on your toughest days can undo your progress. Keeping your emotions in check is easy when things are going well, but managing your emotions when the world isn't cooperating sets you apart.

Push through the grind and maintain the momentum.
