### Quotes
> In fact, I’m going to make the case for why you should donate items you probably haven’t even thought of gifting—your good, intact belongings, not just your junk and throwaways. Giving away your things to neighbors, family members, friends, or people in your community or around the world can greatly enrich and enhance your life and the lives of others. And that, at the end of the day, is what we’re after.
