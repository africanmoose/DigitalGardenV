### Quotes
> Leonardo knew that the best way to look at something analytically is to draw it. Water fascinated him, so he drew thousands of waves, whirlpools, eddies, bubbles, rivulets, currents and vortices. So did the human body. He measured more than forty living men to record their proportions; opening thirty or so cadavers, he drew skeletons, vertebrae, hand and feet bones. He layered muscles and tendons, the better to understand their sophisticated interactions and pictured the skull in cutaway, the eye in its socket, the foetus in the womb. He analysed the flow of blood around the heart, making the world’s first post-mortem diagnosis of arteriosclerosis, and worked out how the aortic valve manages the turbulence of rushing blood. He squinted at the minuscule muscles of the lips and tongue, and the even tinier fovea, at the back of the eyeball. One anatomical treatise alone consists of two hundred and forty virtuosic drawings and thirteen thousand words, and he covered much of the same ground with horses too. He conducted a detailed study of the moon’s surface, and a description of the way light bounced off it. He analysed colour, carefully recording the way leaves change in tone as the sun moves, and describing how landscapes fade into the pale distance.
