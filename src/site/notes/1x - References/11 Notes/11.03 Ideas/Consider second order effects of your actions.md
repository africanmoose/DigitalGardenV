### Summary
- An action has an immediate effect. But then it also has 2nd and 3rd order effects. Try to consider these before making a decision

### Details
- Example: If a few people stand on their tiptoes to see an event, then it ends up with everyone standing on their tiptoes. Everyone is worse off.

### Quotes
> Warren Buffett used a very apt metaphor once to describe how the second-order problem is best described by a crowd at a parade: Once a few people decide to stand on their tip-toes, everyone has to stand on their tip-toes. No one can see any better, but they’re all worse off.
> Buffett, Warren.
