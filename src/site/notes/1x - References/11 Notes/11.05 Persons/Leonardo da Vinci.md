### Summary
- The ultimate renaissance man

### Notebooks
Da vinci's notebooks contained an estimated 60,000 pages of diagrams and notes. He wrote his script in a mirror format, possibly to prevent people from reading it, or perhaps to prevent smudging as he was left-handed.

These two are kept in the National Library of Madrid:

### Details
- Leonardo was able to think of ideas or concepts that were way ahead of his time.
- He was curious about the way the world worked, observing birds and plants for hours, making notes and detailed diagrams.
- He had no formal schooling, but learnt either by himself or from the experience of others.
- He readily combined the experiences adn knowlege from diverse disciplines

> To really explain knowledge as an alloy, something that is strengthened when we mix certain components in, we can look at the life of Leonardo da Vinci.* In Walter Isaacson’s account, he explains that Leonardo was able to conceive of things in an extraordinary way leading him to discover or validate concepts that were often hundreds of years ahead of his time.7

>Leonardo was curious; he wanted to know how the world worked and why. He also possessed and honed the skill of intense observation, studying birds and plant stems for hours, or making extensive notes and drawings on eddies of water and optics. He would observe a phenomenon, make a guess as to the principles behind it, and seek to validate those through further observation. Leonardo was willing to challenge accepted truths, seeking to understand them by questioning them. “His lack of reverence for authority and his willingness to challenge received wisdom would lead him to craft an empirical approach for understanding nature that foreshadowed the scientific method developed more than a century later by Bacon and Galileo.”8

>He was mainly self-taught, having had almost no formal schooling, but he recognized the value of learning from the experiences of others. A quote from one of his journals reads, “Get the master of arithmetic to show you how to square a triangle.…Ask Benedetto Protinari by what means they walk on the ice in Flanders…Get a master of hydraulics to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and mill in the Lombard manner”9 These notes suggest that no one has the time to do everything, and the alloy that is our knowledge must contain what we can learn from others.

>Leonardo also readily combined knowledge from different disciplines, his understanding of nature informing his art, or his theatrical experiences pushing him to understand more about optics. His interdisciplinary approach strengthened his knowledge by giving it a varied practicality and usefulness. “Thus, Leonardo became a disciple of both experience and received wisdom. More important, he came to see that the progress of science came from a dialogue between the two. That in turn helped him realize that knowledge also came from a related dialogue: that between experiment and theory.”

> Obsessive repetition and variation: when Leonardo developed an interest, he would gnaw away at it for years whether it seemed useful or not. So Pacioli might have seen two hundred pictures of convex mirrors; thousands of geometrical diagrams; five hundred illustrations of flying machines, insects, and birds; a hundred-odd plans for devices that could divert, lift or pump water. This persistence was one of Leonardo’s most vital attributes, and it could be playful too – how else to explain the scores of sketches of old men with distinctive ‘nutcracker’ profiles, their chins approaching their noses, who pop up at regular intervals? These seem to have been recreational drawings, Leonardo having fun on the page.

> Looking at the human body, he puzzled out the mysterious workings of the vital aortic valve, four hundred years before anyone else; he was the first person to objectively describe the roots of the teeth; and he was the only person before Frederik Ruysch, two hundred years later, to make casts of organs. His experiments on the nervous system of frogs and dogs would not be repeated before Alexander Stuart in 1739, and his analysis of muscle groups in the 1490s foreshadows the twentieth-century science of ergonomics. Looking at whale-bone fossils emerging from Tuscan hillsides, he more or less invented the science of ichnology, which would not be pursued again before the 1820s, and his correct deduction that those hillsides had once been sea bed anticipated James Hutton’s Theory of the Earth, published in 1785. His description of impetus strikes us with its similarity to Newton’s first law of motion, published in 1687. One hundred and fifty years before Christiaan Huygens, he demonstrated the diffraction of waves passing through an aperture: he had deduced, as Huygens would, that light travelled in waves. His experimental discovery that the friction between two surfaces is independent of the area of contact matched the laws of friction worked out by Guillaume Amontons in 1699. Ball bearings matching his design would not come into use until the 1800s. He came up with an anti-friction metallic alloy strikingly similar to the first to be patented, Isaac Babbitt’s of 1839. He pursued aerodynamics, fluid dynamics and mechanics at levels that would not be matched for a hundred years or more. And although he definitely didn’t ‘invent the helicopter’, he did design machines, probably for the theatre, which would have generated some lift.26
