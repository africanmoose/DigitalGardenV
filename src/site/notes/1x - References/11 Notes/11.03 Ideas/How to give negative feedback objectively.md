### Quotes
So how can we all learn to craft a culture of candid feedback, one
that delivers negative feedback without ruining anyone’s day? Well, there are a few steps to follow. First, root your analysis in objective, non-judgemental terms. ‘I noticed you cut Hermione off a few times in that meeting’ is much more effective than ‘You are incredibly rude.’ Similarly, telling people ‘You are wrong’ or ‘You are incompetent’ is going to make that person feel attacked and defensive – it’s too subjective (not to mention a little rude, too). Just stick to the facts. Second, focus on the tangible results of what’s gone wrong.
Again, subjectivity is your enemy. So simply highlight, factually, the consequence of what you observed. For example, ‘I noticed that after you interrupted Ron in the meeting the discussion died down a bit. That’s a real shame because I would have really liked to hear what other people have to say.’
