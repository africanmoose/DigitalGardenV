### Quotes
> I once wrote a script for a training film about decision-making, and talked to various experts on the subject. They explained to me that if you have a decision to make, the first question you must ask is: “When does this decision have to be made?” You live in the real world, so there is always a cut-off point.

> But once it’s been agreed when that real-world decision has to happen, why make it before the deadline arrives?

> Why?

> Well, it would be foolish, because if you can wait longer, two incredibly important things may happen.
> 1.You may get new information.
> 2.You may get new ideas.
