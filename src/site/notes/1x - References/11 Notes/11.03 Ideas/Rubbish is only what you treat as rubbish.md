### Summary
- Rubbish is only defined by how we treat something.

### Details
- Everything we think of as rubbish we initially bought because we wanted it. It wasn't rubbish then. 
- When something is dirty, wornout or broken then we think of it as 'rubbish'

### Quotes
> What is rubbish exactly? Things that are dirty, worn out, unusable, no longer useful, no longer needed, and so on. And yet nothing starts out as rubbish. Things become rubbish when they are treated as rubbish.
