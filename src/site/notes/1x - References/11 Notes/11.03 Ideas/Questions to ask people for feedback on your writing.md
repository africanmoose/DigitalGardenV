### Quotes
> If you are an experienced writer, and you show people your work, there are four questions you need to ask:
> - Where were you bored?
 > - Where could you not understand what was going on?
> - Where did you not find things credible?
 > - Was there anything that you found emotionally confusing?
> Once you have the answers to these, then you go away, decide how valid the problems are…and fix them yourself. 

> The people you have asked will probably suggest their solutions too. Ignore these completely. Smile, look interested, thank them and leave, because they have no idea what they’re talking about. Unless they are writers themselves. Then…listen carefully. But at the end of the day, you and only you must decide which criticisms and suggestions you accept.

> While you’re considering all this don’t ask yourself who is right. Ask which idea is better.
