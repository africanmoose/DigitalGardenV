### Quotes
> Travel is indeed an excellent way of slowing down time. Both Wittmann and Taylor recall experiences of living abroad in foreign countries as some of the longest and richest of their lives. Taylor remembers visiting the UK after eight months in eastern Germany, just after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and feeling like eight years had passed. “I felt a bit like a Roman soldier returning from years in a distant corner of the empire,” he says.

> But you don’t need to go on expensive holidays to slow down time – and constantly doing so can also become routine. Going anywhere you haven’t been before – even if that’s just to a different neighbourhood – can help. The same goes for any change to your usual routine, such as getting to know new people, seeking out new and surprising information or taking up new hobbies. As a bonus, these activities also reduce our chances of getting stuck in echo chambers.
