### Quotes
>  Multiple studies have shown that those who walk briskly live longer, and a recent study from Dunedin in New Zealand reported that slower walkers had smaller brain volumes at the age of 45 than brisk walkers. That makes it pretty clear that slow walking is a lot less valuable than brisk walking. Walking speed tends to decline with age, and fitness levels obviously have an impact, so a better guide is to walk at a speed that gets you a little out of breath. (If you’re fit, this may be hard to do, so just walk fast!)
