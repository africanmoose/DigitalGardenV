## Quote in context
> Companionship, on the other hand, he regarded as vital: “Of all the things which wisdom provides to make us entirely happy, much the greatest is the possession of friendship.” Epicurus thought people should never eat alone, and should live close to a circle of friends who would nourish each other’s minds, help each other in daily life, and support each other in times of struggle. He candidly described friendship as something which starts from a point of need, or from the hope of mutual benefit, but then grows into sheer pleasure at having the other person in one’s life. He also viewed friendship without some element of mutual need as being somewhat vacuous.
