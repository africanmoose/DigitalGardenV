### Summary
- We can never do one thing. **Whenever we interact with a system, we need to ask, “And then what? What will the wider repercussions of our actions be?”** 

### Details
- Everything we do affects something else, and likely more than one thing
- Externalities (an unintended consequence) affect everyone.
- They may be minor, but they can also compound over time.
- They can be positive or negative.
- When interacting with a system, ask, 'and then what?' to consider externalities
