### Quotes
Some sea sponges can live more than 2,000 years. Despite having bodies that are soft and porous, they have skeletal structures that are strong and durable. When sponges are damaged by strong currents or munched on by predators, they don’t necessarily float away or die. Some can regenerate via survival pods: cells that allow a new sponge to develop once conditions improve. This capacity to absorb, filter, and adapt enables sponges to grow and thrive. And it’s a capacity that matters a great deal for humans too. Being a sponge is more than a metaphor. It’s a character skill—a form of proactivity that’s vital to realizing hidden potential. Improving depends not on the quantity of information you seek out, but the quality of the information you take in. Growth is less about how hard you work than how well you learn.
