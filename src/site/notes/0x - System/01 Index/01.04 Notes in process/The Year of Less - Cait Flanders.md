### Summary
- Cait Flanders was deep in debt and not happy, so she set herself a challenge of not shopping for a year.

### How I discovered it
- I have been looking at minimalism books - goodreads recommended this one to me.

### How the book changed me
- This book was so not what I expected. But I enjoyed it nonetheless. I thought it would be a straightforward 'no shopping for a year, my life improved' but she deals with so many topics: depression, dealing with death, starting a new job that it ended up being much more impactful. and realistic.
