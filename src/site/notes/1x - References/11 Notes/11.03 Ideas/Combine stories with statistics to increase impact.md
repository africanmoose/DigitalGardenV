### Quotes
> Storytelling is a powerful way to get your achievements across, but you don’t have to impress and entertain others by spinning elaborate, grandiose tales. In fact, shorter, more concise stories are often the most effective in the professional context. This could be as straightforward as sharing a brief anecdote about a challenge you overcame or talking about a project you’re proud of in a conversation, in a meeting, or even in an email. Listeners are twenty-two times more likely to remember statistics combined with stories than facts alone. What’s even more surprising is that when you tell a story, your listener’s brain will actually start to sync with yours, a process known as neural coupling. This means that when you substitute “I talked to the vendor about our contract” with “I know revenue has been down this year, so I negotiated a 25 percent discount for the next year to bring us in under budget and offer some positive news we can share with the board,” your boss doesn’t just hear about what you did, but they experience the same positive emotions––excitement, inspiration, and relief––that you felt.
