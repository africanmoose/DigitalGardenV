### Summary
- When we learn forward, we show that we like something. We can also hear, see, touch and smell it better

### Details
- If someone says something important, lean in to show them that you are engaged.
- If you agree with what someone is saying, lean forward to signal that
- If you feel you are on the same page with someone, lean in to show them that.

### Quotes
> Highlight: This simple movement activates a specific part of your brain that makes you feel more motivated. In a fascinating experiment, researchers found that when they asked participants to lean forward, they had increased neural activation in the left frontal cortex. This is the part of our brain associated with desire and motivation—it creates an eagerness to move toward something. The control group, who was asked to lean back, didn’t exhibit any increased activation at all.
			
> Humans lean toward people, things, and ideas they like. When we lean, we’re able to activate our five senses easier.
> We lean in to see something more clearly.
> We lean in when we need to hear something better.
> We lean in when we’re about to touch something.
> We can lean in to smell something better.
> We lean in when we want to pick up something and taste it.

> Leaning in is the single fastest way to look (and feel) interested and engaged. I think of leaning in as a nonverbal boldface. When you lean in, it bolds or highlights whatever has just been shared. I lean to show:
> - Emphasis: If someone is saying something I think is important, I lean into them. If I’m saying something important, I lean in slightly.
> - Agreement: If I agree with what someone is saying, I always bold it with a lean. It’s to demonstrate to that person that I’m so into what you’re saying, I want to get closer to hear it better. And it helps me feel even more motivated about understanding them.
> - Partnership: If I’m feeling kinship with someone or want to show I’m on the same page, I will lean in toward them. This works especially well in the first few minutes of an interaction. Dr. Essel leans into and down to his patients’ level to build rapport.

> One of the biggest misconceptions about leaning is that leaning back looks cool. Well, it is literally cool . . . as in cold. Leaning back or slouching is a Danger Zone cue. One of the most uncharismatic things you can do is lean back, slouch, or recline while someone is sharing something that’s important to them. Leaders make a point of leaning
