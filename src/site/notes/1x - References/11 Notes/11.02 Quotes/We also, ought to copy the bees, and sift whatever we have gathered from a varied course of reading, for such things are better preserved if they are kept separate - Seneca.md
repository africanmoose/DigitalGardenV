## Quote
 “We also, ought to copy the bees, and sift whatever we have gathered from a varied course of reading, for such things are better preserved if they are kept separate; then, by applying the supervising care with which our nature has endowed us … we could so blend those several flavors into one delicious compound that, even though it betrays its origin, yet it nevertheless is clearly a different thing from that whence it came.”

## Author
The first-century Roman philosopher Seneca advised readers to mimic bees, who gather nectar across wide fields of flowers, pack it away, and then transform it into their own creation.
