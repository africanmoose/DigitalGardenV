### Summary

- A very extensive and detailed biography of Einsteins life, told in an vivid and interesting manner.

### How I discovered it

- I was in a library in Thika and the guy next to me was reading this book. When he left I picked it up and it was really interesting.

### How the book changed me

- I have an increased respect for Einstein and his scientific genius, but also his principles as a human being.
