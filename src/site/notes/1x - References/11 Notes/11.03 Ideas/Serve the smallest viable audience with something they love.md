### Quotes
> This is the mantra of the self-absorbed, short-term, hype-hustling promoter calling themselves a marketer. They say a good idea needs endless promotion because people deserve to hear about it.
> There’s a better way to think about this: First, ten. In two words, this is the secret of the new marketing.
> Find ten people. Ten people who trust you/respect you/need you/listen to you…
> Those ten people need what you have to sell or want it. And if they love it, you win. If they love it, they’ll each find ten more people (or a hundred, or a thousand, or perhaps as few as three). Repeat.
> If they don’t love it, you need a new product or more insight about the ten people you choose. Begin again.
> When you serve the smallest viable audience, your idea spreads. Your business grows. Not as fast as you want, but faster than you could ever imagine.
