### Quotes
> more useful approach is to seek out and embrace optionality. If we can try something, experience something, or launch something that comes with an undo button, that path is far more resilient than irrevocable decisions that can’t be undone.

> If there’s an easy and productive way to backtrack, the best response might be, “Sure, why not?”

> Forward motion with optionality doesn’t involve stalling when commitments are the better path to make a change happen. Instead, when all other things are similar, choosing the option that gives us more options as the world unfolds is the better choice.
