### Quotes
> To help you and your idea stand out even more—and increase the chance of it actually being executed—present it with a potential solution. Even if you’re venturing into unfamiliar territory, a sound, well-thought-out plan signals competence. It proves you can dissect complex situations and clarifies your intentions, which will set your manager at ease.
> 
> Start small, leveraging the foot-in-the-door technique. Proposing an overhaul of your company’s entire inventory process, for example, could raise people’s hackles. Instead, introduce manageable changes that are easier for people to embrace, like phasing in a few new features to start. You could also suggest a trial period, for example, after which everyone reassesses whether to proceed or go back to business as usual.

> Am I prepared to be part of the solution? Venting without ideas and suggestions about how to make things better is like shouting into a void—satisfying for a moment but ultimately useless. If your boss dismisses every suggestion you bring forward and you go to them griping, “You never listen to me!,” it probably won’t lead to change. Say instead, “I understand every idea can’t be implemented, but I want to make sure mine are valuable. What criteria do you use to evaluate suggestions?”
