### Quotes
> The science of sperm began in 1677, when Dutch microbiologist Antoni van Leeuwenhoek looked through one of his [500 homemade microscopes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7012367/) and saw what he called "[semen animals](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-59259-876-2_1)". He concluded, in 1683, that it wasn't the egg that contained the miniature and entire human, as previously believed, but that man comes "[from an animalcule in the masculine seed](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-59259-876-2_1)". By 1685, he had decided that each spermatozoon contains [an entire miniature person, complete with its own "living soul"](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstl.1685.0057).
