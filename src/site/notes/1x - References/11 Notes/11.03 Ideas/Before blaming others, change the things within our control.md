### Quotes
> • Have I changed what I can control? If you’re silent in meetings, can you really blame your boss for not spotlighting your achievements? If your boss’s instructions are vague and confusing, have you asked enough follow-up questions to get clarity? Before laying blame, ask yourself: Have I taken charge of what’s within my power? Start by adjusting your own actions. This alone could change how your boss responds to you or eliminate the annoying behavior altogether.
