### Quotes
>  Because I was only allowed to buy one new sweatshirt, as an example, it had to be the best. Not the best brand or the most expensive or the highest quality. It had to be the best for me. It had to fit right and feel good and be something I could imagine wearing almost every day, because that’s what all the items in my new, tiny wardrobe did—they were worn almost every day.
