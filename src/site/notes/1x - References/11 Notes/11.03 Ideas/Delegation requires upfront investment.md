### Quotes
> One might wonder why everyone doesn’t do the same thing. I believe the reason is that most people are unwilling to do the time-consuming design work up front. It is an investment—and a substantial one—in future personal productivity. If I had simply tossed a bunch of financial responsibilities to my CAO and wished her the best of luck, I don’t think there would have been a happy ending. I had to work with her to make sure that she and I had a similar view of what we were trying to accomplish. I also had to work with my boss, the Provost of the University, to get permission to shift some of my responsibilities to my CAO. That work caused me to spend more of my time in my first year or two as Dean on the financial portfolio in my job than I would have spent had I just decided to keep the thick job. So there was a cost, a real cost. But I would argue that in the next decade, the savings have been easily ten times the up-front cost—and they are growing with each passing year.

> But the key is that the CAO is happier—as are the others who have taken big slices of what could have and even should have been my job. And I am happier too!
