### Summary
- It is not as important to chose the right work as it is to finish the work that you start

### Quotes
> Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.
