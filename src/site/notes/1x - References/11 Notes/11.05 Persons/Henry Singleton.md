### Quotes
> Most people look to Warren Buffett as being the king of capital allocation, but Warren Buffett looks to Henry Singleton.

> Singleton built one of the most successful conglomerates in American history, transforming business while remaining virtually unknown. While Wall Street chased fads, Singleton quietly turned the industrial conglomerate Teledyne into a business juggernaut with *20.4% annual returns* over nearly three decades—outperforming Buffett, outmaneuvering rivals, and outlasting the hype. Charlie Munger said Singleton had *“the best operating and capital deployment record in American business—bar none.”*
