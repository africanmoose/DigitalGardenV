### Quotes
> If you get through a period of psychological stress and you recover effectively, you can actually adapt and become better and more tolerant to stress. The military have a term for this: ‘stress preconditioning’. For many years, they have conducted ‘stress inoculation training’ on soldiers to help prepare them for the inevitable stresses of the job

> What science has now uncovered is that exposing yourself to certain levels of stress of a wide variety of types induces adaptive changes at a cellular level, which can enhance your ability to deal with that stress. Recent research has also revealed a tantalising glimpse of a ‘cross-transfer effect’, which means the improved stress tolerance – to, for example, the physical stress of exercise – can carry over into improved tolerance of other stressors

> It’s only by starting an exercise program at the appropriate level for your current self and then continuing it, following the principle of progressive overload (where you increase the volume and/or intensity over time), that you’ll adapt to become fitter, bigger, faster, stronger, leaner or more resilient. It’s the repetitive exposure, staying in that productive zone of disequilibrium, that stimulates adaptation.
