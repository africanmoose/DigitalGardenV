### Quotes
>  Pausing shows both competence and confidence. People confident in their delivery don’t need to fill with fluff. And they know listeners will wait for them to finish their points.

> The best kind of pause is a cue I call the breathing pause. This is when you pause and take in a breath. This is important because it gives you something to do in the pause.

> Taking a deep breath has many benefits:
> - It helps keep your vocal pitch nice and low.
 > - It prevents vocal fry.
> - It allows you to increase your volume if you want.
> - It gives you a moment to think if you need it.
>- It makes you sound and feel more confident.
>- And, of course, it prevents you from using verbal fillers.
>- Every time you feel yourself wanting to use a filler, simly take a breath.

> If you do accidentally use a verbal filler, don’t worry! Don’t react. Definitely don’t apologize. Just take the breath after the filler. This is a slow way to retrain your brain that it should pause instead of filling.

> There’s one more great way to use the power pause—as a way to highlight bad behavior. When someone snaps at you or says something inappropriate, don’t snap back or react reflexively. Take a breathing pause. Let it hang in the air. I’ve found this makes the snapper reflect for a moment. They will often take it back, apologize, or think twice before doing it again.
