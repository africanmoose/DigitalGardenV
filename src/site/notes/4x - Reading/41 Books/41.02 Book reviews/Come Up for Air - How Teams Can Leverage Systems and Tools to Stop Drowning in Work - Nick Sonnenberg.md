### Summary
- Ideas on how to increase productivity in organizations

### How I discovered it
- Good reads recommendation

### How the book changed me
- I loved this book. I have heard many of the concepts before in a variety of places, but this is probably the most succint and simplest way I have heard it explained. It also helped me crystalise some of these ideas, or understand why they are so effective.
