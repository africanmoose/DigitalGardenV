## Quote
“It can be hard to appreciate just how much the world will give you what you want after you stop waiting for it to give you what you deserve.

Stop waiting for the world to recognize your potential; start giving the world something positive. Don't wait for a friend's apology; reach out and reconnect. Instead of waiting for the perfect partner, become that partner. Rather than waiting for motivation to exercise, start small and build momentum. Don't complain about something; change it.

Life rewards action.”
