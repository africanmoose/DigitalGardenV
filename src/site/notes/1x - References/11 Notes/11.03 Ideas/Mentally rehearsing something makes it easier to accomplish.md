### Quotes
> Let’s talk about using your amazing brain to mentally rehearse your success.

> If you talk to any world-class athlete, the chances are that they will do some form of mental imagery.

> Professor David Kavanagh from Queensland University of Technology has teamed up with researchers from the University of Plymouth to develop and test a process called ‘functional imagery training’, which involves the use of personalised, emotionally driven, goal-directed mental imagery to plan health behaviours, anticipate obstacles that may come up and mentally try out solutions based on previous successes.
