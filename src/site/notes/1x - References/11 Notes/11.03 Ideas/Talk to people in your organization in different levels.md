### Quotes
> As I rose in rank, that task became harder, and sometimes I tried to convince myself that the work I was doing in the office was more important. Now, clearly, the strategic work of any organization is important, but knowing how your decisions affect the rank and file is equally important. If, as a leader, you fail to spend time on the factory floor, you fail to walk around the cubicles, you fail to talk to the interns, you fail to have coffee with the junior employees, then you will fail to understand what’s happening in your business. And, as a leader, you will eventually just fail.
