### Quotes
> From a tender age society encourages us to lay aside our impetus to do things for their own sake (‘intrinsic’ motivation), and to instead do much of what we do for external reasons. As a young child you were almost certainly an intrinsically-motivated learner, and spent most of your waking hours fascinated by the world, and inventing endless adventures in pursuit of discovering how it all worked. Soon however, schooling converted learning into something you did for external motivations: grades, rewards and punishments.
