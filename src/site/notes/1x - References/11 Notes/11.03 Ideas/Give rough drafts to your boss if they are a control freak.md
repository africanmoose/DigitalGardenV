### Quotes
> What to Do When…You Work with a Control Freak

> Working for (or with) someone who scrutinizes everything you do and demands that you run it past them for approval can push anyone to the brink, but don’t despair. Here’s how to handle an impatient taskmaster:

> • Run with rough drafts. Rather than toiling away for days—or weeks—to craft the perfect deliverable, do a first pass and say, “Here’s what I’ve put together so far. It’s a bit rough around the edges, but I wanted to capture the core ideas and structure so we can shape it into something outstanding.” Your boss will be happy to have input, and you’ll conserve your energy.

> • Overshare. Send a breakdown of items you plan to tackle each week every Monday or shoot over a quick heads-up if you’ll be late to a meeting. While sometimes tedious, sharing this information will satiate your boss’s desire for oversight, while saving you the effort of justifying yourself later: “To keep you in the loop about our progress, I’ve prepped a weekly status memo with a snapshot of recent developments” or “I’m confirming that we’re moving ahead with X. Let me know by Friday if there are any changes.”
