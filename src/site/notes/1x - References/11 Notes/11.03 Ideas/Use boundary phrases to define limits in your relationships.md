### Summary
- Boundary phrases allow us to communicate our limits to our friends and family that our space, time and energy are not limitless.

### Details
- Some ideas are:
	- No
	- I need time for myself
	- Let's compromise
	- I need you to do this first. Then we can do X.
	- I cannot agree to this. You have to meet me halfway on this issue
	- I need some time to think about this. Let's revisit later after I have thought about it.
	-  I want you to stop this behavior. I understand you are hurt/upset/angry. Letâ€™s help you calm down, and then we can talk about it.
	- I see that you are trying to help me, and I appreciate your concern, but I would like to handle things on my own.
	- I prefer not to discuss this topic with you. It makes me feel uncomfortable.
	- I am not comfortable doing this right now. Can we figure out a better solution?
	- This is not going to work for me.
	- I'm not available.
	-
