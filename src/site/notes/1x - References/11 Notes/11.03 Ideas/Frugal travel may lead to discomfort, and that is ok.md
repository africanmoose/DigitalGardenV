### Quotes
> There are always some difficult moments in frugal travel. You will occasionally be cold/hot/lost/exhausted/eat something unidentifiable. But these are often the bits that make you realise that you’re tougher than you thought. And the bits that make the best stories. Besides, people who take a trip expecting everything to be glitch-free and cushy often get more annoyed by a lukewarm meal than a frugal traveller does by taking a bus five hours in the wrong direction. Perhaps most importantly of all, while pricier travel does buy a higher base level of ‘pleasantness’, it seldom provides moments of euphoria or revelation as generously as frugal travel does.
