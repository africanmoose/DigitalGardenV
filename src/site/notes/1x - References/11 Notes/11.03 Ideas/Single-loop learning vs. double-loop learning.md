### Summary
- Single-loop learning is when we learn a new skill, and get to a point where it seems to work and then we keep on doing things at that level.
- Double-look learning: we learn a new skill. Then once it is learned, we pause and try to analyze what could be improved or changed. This allows us to potentially adapt to another level or continually improve our model, especially in the face of new information

### Details
- Similar to OODA: Observe Orient Decide Act and repeat. The observe allows for adjustment in future cycles
- The first loop uses the goals or decision, the second loop allows the modificcation of the original goals/decisions
- we resist double loop learning due to resistance to change, fear of failure and overemphasis on control
- Since the world is dynamic, not learning can make us fall behind
- Take time to anyalyze and review decisions in the past, considering how to improve in future. THis is often painful in the short term as it involves revealing our weaknesses and shortcomings.
- Smart people are not used to failure, adn so they struggle to learn from their mistakes and often try to blame others for errors 
- example: managers who assume their employees will not do well, and so micromanage, resulting in work poorly done. teachers who think their students will do badly and thus onyl assign work, resulting in poorly performing students.
