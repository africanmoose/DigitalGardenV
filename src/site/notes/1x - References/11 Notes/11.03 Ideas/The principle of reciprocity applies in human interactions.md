### Summary
- The principle of reciprocity in physics - for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction, seems also to work with humans
- For example, if we treat people well, they tend to also treat us well.

### Details
- Occasionally it may not work, but in agregate over time it is true. Thus if we want people to be kind to us, be kind to them.
- People tend to receive what they offer to the world.
- Our actions do not happen in isolation but are part of an interconnected world

### Quotes

> While reciprocity isn’t as reliable when it comes to humans as it is with physics, the concept can help you achieve better outcomes. Sometimes we go first and go positive and get nothing back, as is the case if we smile at a stranger walking on the street. Most times they’ll smile back at you, but every once in a while, you’re met with a scowl. We tend to forget the times our smile elicited a smile in response and remember the times when we received nothing in return, and so we stop smiling. However, the small loss we occasionally experience as a result of putting ourselves out there and not having it reciprocated is more than compensated for by the gains the rest of the time. If you want to get an idea of the true value of engaging in positive reciprocal behavior, just make a list of your outcomes in any given week. Life is easier and more enjoyable when we act on starting and maintaining win-win relationships with everyone. And as we explained, reciprocity has been part of our biological makeup for a very long time.

> Become what you want to see in the world and it will be so. If you want an amazing relationship with your partner, be an amazing partner. If you want people to be thoughtful and kind, be thoughtful and kind. If you want people to listen to you, listen to them. The best way to achieve success is to deserve success. Small changes in your actions change your entire world.

> People tend to receive what they offer to the world. Thus, to change our world, we must change what we offer to others.

> Reciprocity teaches us to be mindful of how our actions tend to come back on us. It’s important to remember that we are part of the world, and thus our actions do not happen in isolation, but are instead part of an interconnected web of effects.
