### Quotes
> Another tactic we use at Leverage is a quarterly check-in with an efficiency consultant. Everyone at Leverage, regardless of their role, has a quarterly one-on-one meeting with an efficiency consultant who simply takes a quick look through their tools (Gmail, Asana, Slack, and so on) to see how they’re using them and whether they’re actually practicing what we preach. Think of it like a personal trainer for efficiency. This is not to micromanage or punish people who are doing a bad job; it’s more a chance for our consultants to give the team some guidance and make sure people are using our tools efficiently. I realize most companies don’t have efficiency consultants, but it could be worth appointing a tech-savvy individual to lead a quarterly or yearly systems check-in with your team. Inbox Zero is a perfect place to start.
