### Summary
- Design involves removing the unnecessary so that the necessary is absolutely clear. Though decoration is important, and an aspect of design, it is not the primary aspect.

### Details
- Anything that is not a useful part of your story should be eliminated.

### Quotes
- Simple messages cut out all the stuff that doesn’t matter. Everything is there to get the point across, and anything else that’s a distraction is vigorously stripped away. Empty platitudes, useless fluff, anything that isn’t a necessary component of your story is another place to lose the receiver. You have only a small window to be heard, so don’t waste it. Design is not the same thing as decoration. Decoration is adding ornamentation to “pretty things up
