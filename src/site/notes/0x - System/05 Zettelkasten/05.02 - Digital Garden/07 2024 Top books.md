Not in any particular order....

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/The Great Mental Models Vol 1 - Shane Parrish\|The Great Mental Models Vol 1 - Shane Parrish]]

Shane Parrish has always been one of my favorite authors, from whom I learn the most. This book is no exception, and for bonus points, check out [his website](fs.blog)

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Hidden Potential - Adam Grant\|Hidden Potential - Adam Grant]]

A collection of scientifically proved methods to improve ourselves. I read a previous book by Adam Grant, and really enjoyed it - [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.01 Book Notes/Originals How Non-Conformists Move the World - Adam Grant\|Originals How Non-Conformists Move the World - Adam Grant]]. Hidden Potential did not disappoint, and has a lot of interesting information.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Cues - Master the Secret Language of Charismatic Communication - Vanessa Van Edwards\|Cues - Master the Secret Language of Charismatic Communication - Vanessa Van Edwards]]

Did you know that you can change how you think just by your posture? That if you phrase a statement like a question people won't believe you? This and many other interesting points about how our body language sends a strong signal to others.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Energy - A Beginners Guide - Vaclav Smil\|Energy - A Beginners Guide - Vaclav Smil]]

All matter is energy, and everything we do is somehow connected to energy. A fascinating look into how energy moves our modern world. Recommended by Bill Gates. After reading this, I have a much greater appreciation for energy and how everything: the houses in which we live, the clothes we wear, how late we stay up at night, how we travel and what we eat is based on energy. It is easy to forget how recently humans have had clean light at the flick of a switch and the ability to travel great distances in a short period of time.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Simply Put - Why Clear Messages Win - and How to Design Them - Ben Guttmann\|Simply Put - Why Clear Messages Win - and How to Design Them - Ben Guttmann]]

How to craft simple and clear messages. Although the central theme is applicable to all aspects of life, it really has a focus on marketing and advertising. I intend to improve my writing by being more simple and clear, especially my secular writing.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Feel-Good Productivity - How to Do More of What Matters to You - Ali Abdaal\|Feel-Good Productivity - How to Do More of What Matters to You - Ali Abdaal]]

A well researched productivity book that focuses a bit less on the nuts and bolts and more on the motivation aspect of it. The idea that you work better if you are happy is probaby accurate! I have followed Ali Abdaals [Youtube channel]() for a while and its always interesting. Also, he is a user of [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.03 Ideas/Zettelkasten Method\|Zettelkasten Method]]. It has made me realize the ultimate productivity hack: being happy and enjoying your work, even as it goes through other practical ways to be productive.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Stillness is the key - Ryan Holiday\|Stillness is the key - Ryan Holiday]]

Slow down and take time to think instead of being caught up with the mad rush that is modern life. I have read his other books and quite enjoyed them [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.01 Book Notes/Ego is the enemy - Ryan Holiday\|Ego is the enemy - Ryan Holiday]] and [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/The obstacle is the way - Ryan Holliday\|The obstacle is the way - Ryan Holliday]] I now have the goal of cultivating more stillness, more time to think and more mindfulness and consideration before acting

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Undeniable - How Biology Confirms Our Intuition That Life Is Designed - Douglas Axe\|Undeniable - How Biology Confirms Our Intuition That Life Is Designed - Douglas Axe]]

Axe argues that even little children have an innate sense of when something was designed by someone else and when it is due to random chance. And the incredible detail and range that we see in biology has the unmistakeable mark so something designed. I like the observation that in the current scientific atmosphere, it is almost taboo to question evolution. And yet, science it meant to be all about questioning beliefs and ideas to match existing facts.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/A Year of Living Simply - The joys of a life less complicated - Kate Humble\|A Year of Living Simply - The joys of a life less complicated - Kate Humble]]

Interesting book about a year of living a 'simpler' life though she clearly has enough assets to do this without hassle. I have been trying to read books on minimalism and simplification. I am really trying to simplify my life more - this gave me some more ideas and motivation. I think the most interesting thing out of this was learning about earthship houses.

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Zero -The Biography of a Dangerous Idea - Charles Seife\|Zero -The Biography of a Dangerous Idea - Charles Seife]]

 A history of the use of zero as a number. Invented by the Babylonians, and developed by the Hindus, the fear of using it in the West held back Western scientific development. I never really had an appreciation for zero as much as I do know, and for how things that seem obvious to us now actually took millennia for humans to figure out

### [[4x - Reading and Learning/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/The Simple Guide to a Minimalist Life - Leo Babauta\|The Simple Guide to a Minimalist Life - Leo Babauta]]

As the title says, its a simple guide. Just the basic principles, and I think it's all the better for it. I have been exploring minimalism recently and Leo Babauta's name keeps on coming up. It has some nice ideas, some nice principles, and generally I think it just gave me a little push along my minimalist discovery path

### How to win friends and influence Fungi

I thoroughly enjoyed this book, that also teaches a lot of random and unconnected interesting points. These are the best kinds to learn!

### **Love, Africa - Jeffrey Gettleman**

Gettleman was the bureau chief of the New York Times here in Nairobi, and still lives here. His book is an interesting look at his life, as well as a good picture of East Africa.
