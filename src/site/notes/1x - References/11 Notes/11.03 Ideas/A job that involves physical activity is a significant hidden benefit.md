### Quotes
> If you have a job that involves significant amounts of physical activity, I think that’s a massive fringe benefit that’s got to be worth thousands – if not tens of thousands – of dollars (or equivalent) of additional wages every year. Nearly 70 years ago, a famous study looked at the heart health of London bus drivers and conductors. It found that the conductors who walked up and down bus aisles continuously throughout the workday were much less likely to develop or die from heart disease than the drivers, who sat pretty much constantly while at work
