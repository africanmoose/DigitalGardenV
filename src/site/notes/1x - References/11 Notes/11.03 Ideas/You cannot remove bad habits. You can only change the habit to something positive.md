### Summary
- You can not really delete bad habits. However you can keep the trigger and reward and change the activity.

### Details
- For example, a trigger might be feeling sad, the activity eating junk food, and the reward is a hit of dopamine. We could replace the activity with going for a run instead.

### Quotes
You can never truly extinguish bad habits. Rather, to change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. That’s the rule: If you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you can shift the routine and change the habit. Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same.—Charles Duhigg
