### Quotes
> When something first catches our attention, we turn our head toward it. Biologically it’s easier and takes less energy to move just our head. If we’re really interested, we turn our torso—all the better to be prepared to engage or embrace the object of our attention. And if we want to give it our full attention and maybe even get closer to investigate, we turn our toes as well.

> You’re so important to me, I’m going to angle my entire body toward you.

> A colleague speaks up in a meeting, and we don’t even bother to turn toward that person, focusing on the presentation slide deck at the front of the room.

> Our partner comes home with great news and our gaze stays locked on the TV instead of moving to them. “Great news,” we call over our shoulder.

> One of the best ways to use fronting is to make a point of turning toward someone and aligning with them. This is especially important when you’re taking notes on a computer.
