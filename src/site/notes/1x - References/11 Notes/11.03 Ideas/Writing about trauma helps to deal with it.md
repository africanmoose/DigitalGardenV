### Quotes
> Expressive writing should be free from constraint, and it’s up to the writer to decide what topics count as emotionally traumatic: researchers have found that the more specific their instructions are, or the more they constrain the topics that participants can write about, the less effective the exercise is. Any structure in the writing needs to come from the participant, not the researcher. That said, if participants, in writing, identify benefits to their traumatic experiences, or formulate their own coping strategies, they’re more likely to enjoy greater benefits. Using language of insight (‘now I realise that…’) or cause (‘one consequence was that...’) in your writing is a sign that you’ve processed your emotions so they will stress you less in future. On the other hand, writing that just recounts the facts of a trauma, without an acknowledgement of its emotional effects, won’t be effective.

> If you experience fresh trauma, when should you start to write about it? The research suggests that you shouldn’t rush to put pen to paper: one to two months after the event is probably best, but no sooner. And there’s no difference between writing completed in one day, or over several days or weeks.

> There are undoubtedly multiple factors at play. As we verbally process trauma, we have to name and label our emotions: and this practice, in turn, is known to improve life satisfaction. It’s known as the A-to-D emotion theory, in which ‘analogue’ emotions (non-verbal, woolly, hard to organise, imprecise) are turned into ‘digital’ (verbal, cognitive, easy-to-organise) chunks. ‘Your writing goes from more emotional to more cognitive,’ Elizabeth Broadbent, who had led the New Zealand study, puts it. The more care we take to identify differences between our negative emotions, the more likely we are to understand them, and act effectively in the future. The same applies if we organise our experiences, and our emotional reactions to them, into a coherent story – easier to do on the page than orally. ‘When people write expressively about past trauma, they’re placing it in the context of the rest of their lives and they’re reducing the impact that it has: it’s no longer sitting at the back of your mind, having a subconscious effect,’ continues Broadbent. ‘You’re brought it to the surface, you’ve dealt with it, you’ve made sense of it, now you can move on.’
