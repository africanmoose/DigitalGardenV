### Summary
- When trying to learn something new, take a break after learning to do nothing. This will improve our memory

### Details
- First discovered in 1900 by German psychologist Georg Muller. The subjects were given a list of meaningless syllables to learn. One group continued learning immediately and the second group were given a 6 minute break before continuing. 
- The second group remembered 50% of their list as compared to 28% of the first group  after 90 minutes
- In a 2000 study, those wtih neurological injuries did a similar test and showed triple the number of words they could remember.

The remarkable memory-boosting benefits of undisturbed rest were first documented in 1900 by the German psychologist Georg Elias Muller and his student Alfons Pilzecker. In one of [their many experiments on memory consolidation](http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/6/2/77.full), Muller and Pilzecker first asked their participants to learn a list of meaningless syllables. Following a short study period, half the group were immediately given a second list to learn – while the rest were given a six-minute break before continuing.

When tested one-and-a-half-hours later, the two groups showed strikingly different patterns of recall. The participants given the break remembered nearly 50 percent of their list, compared to an average of 28 percent for the group who had been given no time to recharge their mental batteries. The finding suggested that our memory for new information is especially fragile just after it has first been encoded, making it more susceptible to interference from new information.

Although a handful of other psychologists occasionally returned to the finding, it was only in the early 2000s that the broader implications of it started to become known, with a pioneering study by Sergio Della Sala at the University of Edinburgh and Nelson Cowan at the University of Missouri.

The team was interested in discovering whether reduced interference might improve the memories of people who had suffered a neurological injury, such as a stroke. Using a similar set-up to Muller and Pilzecker’s original study, they presented their participants with lists of 15 words and tested them 10 minutes later. In some trials, the participants remained busy with some standard cognitive tests; in others, they were asked to lie in a darkened room and avoid falling asleep.

The impact of the small intervention was more profound than anyone might have believed. Although the two most severely amnesic patients showed no benefit, the others tripled the number of words they could remember – from 14 to 49 percent, placing them almost within the range of healthy people with no neurological damage.

The next results were even more impressive. The participants were asked to listen to some stories and answer questions an hour later. Without the chance to rest, they could recall just 7 percent of the facts in the story; with the rest, this jumped to 79 percent – an astronomical 11-fold increase in the information they retained.
