### Summary
- A resilient strategy means that if there is a negative random outcome(bad 'luck'), we are able to survice it. If there is a positive random occurence, we can take advantage of it

### Details
- If there is a bad outcome, it doesnt mean we made a bad decision, and vice versa

### Quotes
> Strategies require decisions, and decisions are about the future. Predicting the future in a complex system is an unreliable venture. As a result, unexpected, unpredicted outcomes are the norm.
> It’s worth calling it what it is: luck.
> Resilient strategies accept and account for luck. They benefit from good luck and are resilient enough to survive bad luck.
> It’s tempting (and lazy) to blame bad decisions for bad outcomes. But they might be unrelated.
