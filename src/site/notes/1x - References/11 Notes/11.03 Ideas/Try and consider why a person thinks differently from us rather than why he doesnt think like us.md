### Summary
- Try and consider why a person thinks differently from us rather than why he doesnt think like us

### Details
- "What have you experienced that I haven't that makes you believe what you do?"
- This requires humility in admitting that a person may have valid reasons for a belief that is different from mine

### Quotes
> The question “Why don’t you agree with me?” can have infinite answers. Sometimes one side is selfish, or stupid, or blind, or uninformed.
> But usually a better question is, “What have you experienced that I haven’t that makes you believe what you do? And would I think about the world like you do if I experienced what you have?”
> It’s the question that contains the most answers about why people don’t agree with one another.
> But it’s such a hard question to ask.
> It’s uncomfortable to think that what you haven’t experienced might change what you believe, because it’s admitting your own ignorance. It’s much easier to assume that those who disagree with you aren’t thinking as hard as you are.
