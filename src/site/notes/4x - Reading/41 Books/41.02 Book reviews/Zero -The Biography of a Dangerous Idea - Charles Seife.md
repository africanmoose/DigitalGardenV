### Summary
- A history of the use of zero as a number. Invented by the Babylonians, and developed by the Hindus, the fear of using it in the West held back Western scientific development

### How I discovered it
- Recommended by good reads (I think!)

### How the book changed me
- I never really had an appreciation for zero as much as I do know, and for how things that seem obvious to us now actually took millennia for humans to figure out

### Details
- [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.05 Persons/Archimedes\|Archimedes]] was close to discovering the value of zero when he was murdered by a Roman soldier, consigning Western mathematics to darkness for 7 centuries
- [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.05 Persons/Fibonacci (Leonardo of Pisa)\|Fibonacci (Leonardo of Pisa)]] introduced indo-arabic numbers, including zero, to the West.
