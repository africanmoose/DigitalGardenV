### Quotes
> Cleaning is a way to converse with nature. If we keep this idea in mind, then it is clear that aspects of modern life such as air-conditioning, which creates the same environment throughout summer and winter, amount to a refusal to communicate with nature. Becoming used to this will surely lead to the weakening of the body and the mind. When it’s hot, it should be hot. When it’s cold, it should be cold. I think that sweating as you clean, while experiencing nature, is the secret to a healthy body and mind.

> Open a window and interact with nature. Become aware that you are too weak to live in the same environment as living things in the wild. Experience the gentleness and severity of nature against your skin, and feel grateful for the preciousness of the life force. Each morning, open the windows that connect you to nature and inhale the fresh air.
