### Quotes
> The day you no longer believe you have something to prove, the day you no longer believe you must give it your all, the day you think you are entitled to special treatment, the day you think all your hard days are behind you, is the day you are no longer the right leader for the job.
> Leadership requires energy. It requires stamina. It requires resilience. It requires everything you have and then some. The men and women that work for you will feed off your energy. If you look unprepared to deal with the challenges of the day, they will see this. If you look beaten down because today was harder than yesterday, they will feel this. If you are not prepared to give it your all, they will know this. And if you think this is just about leaders in combat, you’re mistaken. This is about every great leader who was given a difficult task and asked to inspire, motivate, and manage the people under their charge.
1.You must bring energy and enthusiasm every single day. 
2.You are not entitled to anything but more hard work. The rank and file are working hard and getting paid less. 
3.Attack each day as though it were critical to the organization’s success.
