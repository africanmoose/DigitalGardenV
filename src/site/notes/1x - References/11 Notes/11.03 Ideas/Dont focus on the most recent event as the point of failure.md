### Quotes
> When the deal falls apart, the team loses the game, or a partnership hits the rocks, it’s easy to focus our energy on the most recent event.
> “What if they had called a different play?”
> This overlooks the real issue. It’s the first move, or the fifth, that led to this problem, not what happened at the last moment.
> Creating the conditions for success is a very different project than finding a heroic move that saves the day.
