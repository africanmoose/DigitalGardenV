### Summary
- Whether a decision is good or bad depends on our attitude after the decision is made

### Details
- In many cases, we can only learn about a decision after we have made it e.g. marriage, career etc.
- The best way to deal with it is to realise there is no perfect decision, and all we can do is change our attitude toward it afterward

### References

### Quotes
> "Whether a decision is good or bad can change based on how you act after the choice is made.

> You can't learn all the lessons beforehand. You learn a lot about what you want in a marriage _after_ getting married. You discover what type of career you enjoy _after_ doing a lot of work. And so it goes in nearly every area of life. In many cases, what you wish you knew ahead of time can only be learned after the decision is made.

> So there is nothing left but to pay attention to what you like, continue to iterate, and commit to making the most of each opportunity. There is no perfect decision. Good decisions are made right after the fact."
