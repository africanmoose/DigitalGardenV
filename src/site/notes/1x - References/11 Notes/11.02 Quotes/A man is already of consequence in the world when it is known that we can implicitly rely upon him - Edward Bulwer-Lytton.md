## Quote
A man is already of consequence in the world when it is known that we can implicitly rely upon him. I have frequently seen in life a person preferred to a long list of applicants for some important charge, which lifts him at once into station and fortune, merely because he has this reputation — that when he says he knows a thing, he knows it, and when he says he will do a thing, he does it.
