### Summary
- People can take everything away from you, but you still have the ability to chose how to react to your circumstances.

### Details
- The words of Viktor Frankl:  'Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.'

### Quotes
>  In his memoirs, Frankl recounts remembering the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, ‘He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how,’ and how those words were so evident in Auschwitz.

> During his time in Auschwitz, Frankl realised that people are capable of terrible things: they can take away all of your belongings, all of your dignity, all of your pride, even all of your loved ones. They can take from you everything but one thing, which he called ‘the last of human freedoms’ and which is one of the key tenets of logotherapy: your ability to choose how you react to your circumstances, to choose your own attitude, to choose your own way
