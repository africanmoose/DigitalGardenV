### Quotes
- “I know this sounds funny to say, but I think viruses are cool. They’re cool because they’re so gnarly. They go in and they take over your cell, and they tell the machinery to stop making cellular things and start building viruses, so all the things that would normally be making your mitochondria, or your cell membrane, those parts now get taken over and turned into hundreds of viruses—little robots!—and when the virus has finally used up all the stuff in your cell, the last instruction is: Blow the cell up!  And the viruses go out, and it’s just evil! It’s like Darth Vader stuff, right? I don’t mean to get a kick out of it, because it’s obviously bad for you, but there’s something fascinating about that."
- “I guess it’s time management, I see it more like, what’s the word, _chunking_? Is that a Tony Robbins word? Where you focus on one thing as completely as you can for two days, and then the rest of it is nagging at your brain waiting to get done, so you have to shift your attentions. I think putting it in blocks of time definitely helps. Like, this is my day when I’m gonna do _this._”
