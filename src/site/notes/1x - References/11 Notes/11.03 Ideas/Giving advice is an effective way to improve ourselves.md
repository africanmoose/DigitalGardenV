### Summary
- When we give advice to others, we are much more likely to pull up our socks and apply that same advice. It also boosts our confidence

### Details
- When we are given advice, we may take it as a vote of no-confidence and it can result in even worse performance

### Quotes
> The more Lauren reflected on her research on the power of advice giving, the more it made sense. She recognized that being asked to give advice conveyed to people that more was expected of them, boosting their confidence. And based on the interviews she’d conducted, Lauren also knew that even on the spot, with no time to think hard about it—people were capable of producing useful insights about how to better tackle the same goals they, themselves, struggled with. Recall how much good advice she garnered even from underperforming salesmen, mediocre students, and other strivers.

> This is a key reason why giving advice to others tends to help us. Another is that we tend to tailor the advice we give based on personal experience. If asked for dieting suggestions, a vegan will offer plant-based tips. If asked about staying in shape, a busy executive will recommend an efficient exercise regimen. In short, when someone asks for guidance, we tell them to do what we would find useful. And after offering that advice to others, we feel hypocritical if we don’t try it ourselves. In psychology, there’s something called the “saying-is-believing effect.” Thanks to cognitive dissonance, after you say something to someone else, you’re more likely to believe it yourself.
