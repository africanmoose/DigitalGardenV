### Quotes
>  Because I was only allowed to buy one new sweatshirt, as an example, it had to be the best. Not the best brand or the most expensive or the highest quality. It had to be the best for me. It had to fit right and feel good and be something I could imagine wearing almost every day, because that’s what all the items in my new, tiny wardrobe did—they were worn almost every day.

> Even if you’re currently living a nomadic life out of a small backpack, you probably own a selection of things that help you cook, eat, bathe, sleep, work, and play. And if you’d like to avoid the constant consumption involved in replacing those things, you’ll want to recognize their value, maintain them, and get things that are well-made enough in the first place that they will last and are fixable.
