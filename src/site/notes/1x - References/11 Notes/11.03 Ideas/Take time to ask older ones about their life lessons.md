### Quotes
> So don’t pooh-pooh the habits of different eras. Bow down before the frugal nanna! Bring the oldest person you know a hot beverage, and ask them how they made things work in times of scarcity. Ask them what made them happy, hopeful and strong when they had next to nothing. Ask them what was good about it. They know how much things can change within a lifetime, and they might just be able to help you understand how much flexibility this requires. And how much we are capable of.
