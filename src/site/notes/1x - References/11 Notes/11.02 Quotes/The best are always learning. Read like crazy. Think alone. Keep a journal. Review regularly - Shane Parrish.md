## Quote
The best are always learning.

Read like crazy.  
Think alone.  
Keep a journal.  
Write stuff down the moment you see it.  
Review regularly.  
Memorize the big ideas to fluency.  
Attack your best ideas.  
And never get high on your own supply.

You don't have to be gifted. You do have to be deliberate.
