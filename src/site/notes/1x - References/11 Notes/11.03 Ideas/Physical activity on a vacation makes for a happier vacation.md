### Quotes
>Then imagine how bored you’ll be. Lying in the blazing sun on the beach, you’ll be stuck in your head with plenty of time to think about your problems. To your surprise, you might start feeling lonely and bored—even restless—with all this free time. The truth is, when it comes to vacation, rest and relaxation aren’t just overrated. They might even work against the very things a trip is meant to cultivate: a mental reset, a sense of relaxation, happiness. A better vacation is one in which vigorous exercise features prominently. That way, you can take a break not just from work and routine life but also from the tyranny of self-absorption.

>The wandering mind, which is [often self-absorbed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5866730/), is generally not a happy one. In [one study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1192439), researchers randomly pinged people on their smart devices during the day to ask them what they were doing and how they felt. The team found that the participants were happiest when they were involved in an activity and not thinking much about anything else, and least happy when they were daydreaming and preoccupied with their own thoughts. Such mind-wandering was at least somewhat frequent in all activities reported except sex. In another study, subjects who remained [physically busy](https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/08/10/2979072.htm) were happier than those who were inactive, even when they were forced into being busy.

>When we are _really_ engaged in activities, we have less opportunity to worry and feel bad. That might be because focusing on a task temporarily quiets the [default network](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1119598109), a set of interconnected brain regions that is most active when a person is self-focused, thinking about the past or imagining the future. The default network is deactivated when people focus on the outside world—and, intriguingly, when they use [psychedelics](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00020/full). In other words, when our full attention is taken up by something outside of ourselves, we are freed from the uncomfortable burden of self-awareness.
