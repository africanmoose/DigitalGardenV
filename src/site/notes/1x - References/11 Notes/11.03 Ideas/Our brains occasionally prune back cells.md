### Summary
- Forgetting is normal and healthy.

### Details
- In child development, this is known as synaptic pruning. Our brains occasionally clean up by killing off a bunch of cells
- This process is normal in living things as well as systems. Every now and then we need to clean up, or prune, or reorganize. 
- We need to have something there before we can prune

### Quotes
- But first, a reminder: forgetting is natural, normal, and healthy. There’s a fancy term for it in child development: synaptic pruning¹. But before you can prune, there must be something _there._ Something that was useful at least once, generally. The question is… when it might finally be useful, will you be able to find it again?
