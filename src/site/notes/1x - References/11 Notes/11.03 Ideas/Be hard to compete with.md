### Quotes
> Most people understand that companies are more valuable if they are difficult to compete with. This is important, and obviously true.

> But this holds true for you as an individual as well. If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money.

> The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it.

> Most people do whatever most people they hang out with do. This mimetic behavior is usually a mistake—if you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with.
