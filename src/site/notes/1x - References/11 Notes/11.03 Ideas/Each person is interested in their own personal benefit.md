### Quotes
> Your boss, like everyone, is tuned in to their personal “radio station,” WII-FM (What’s In It For Me?). Broadcast on their frequency, emphasizing how the boundary you’re setting not only meets your needs but also aligns with their priorities (and pressures) and serves the greater good. By connecting how your saying no can lead to better, higher-quality work, more creative solutions, or a more engaged and less burned-out team, you appeal to your manager’s interest and make it easier for them to see the value in accepting your pushback.
