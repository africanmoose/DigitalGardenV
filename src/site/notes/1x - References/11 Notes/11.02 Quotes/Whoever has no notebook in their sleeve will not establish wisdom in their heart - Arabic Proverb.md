Whoever has no notebook in their sleeve will not establish wisdom in their heart.

## Author
Arabic Proverb recorded by Antoine Galland in a manuscript in Ottomon Istanbul

## Reference

Colbert would have appreciated the discovery made by one of his diplomatic functionaries, Antoine Galland, in a manuscript in Ottoman Istanbul. He took note of the Arabic proverb "Man lam yakun lahu al-daftar fī kummihi lam yuthbit al-h˙ikma fī qalbihi": 'Whoever has no notebook in their sleeve will not establish wisdom in their heart.' Galland would later find fame as the first translator of The Thousand and One Nights, and the many notebooks in which he collected snippets of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish wisdom are now held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France.
