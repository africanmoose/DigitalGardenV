### Quotes
> If hardened criminals and outlaws can’t fight the urge to form groups, it must be quite deeply rooted in our brains. Placing a prisoner in solitary confinement for too long is considered a form of psychological torture,1 demonstrating that human contact is more a necessity than a desire. The truth is, odd as it may seem, much of the human brain is dedicated to and formed by interactions with other people, and we grow to depend on people as a result, to a surprising extent.

> Our brains are fundamentally social organs, and we need to have a range of social connections in order to keep our brains healthy. You may have heard of the Blue Zones: the areas around the world that have the highest number of centenarians (people who live to 100 years old or more). It turns out that one of the things that they all have in common, besides being physically active and eating a healthy diet, is that they have very strong social networks. The opposite of this is being lonely, and it turns out that loneliness has around the same negative impact on your longevity as smoking cigarettes or not doing any exercise.
