### Quotes
> Surprise and delight. When weâ€™re surprised, positive emotions like gratitude and connection intensify up to 400 percent. Perhaps you put extra polish on a joint presentation by adding graphics, charts, and other forms of data visualization without being asked. If someone asks you for feedback on something, send a video recording of your input rather than just leaving comments in a doc. If you come across a book your colleague or a leader might enjoy, mail a copy to their office, along with a handwritten note.
