### Summary
- If we only do stuff we already know, we will almost always succeed in what we are doing but we will also never grow and learn anything new. Failure is a sign we are stretching to something that we dont know.

### Details
- If we aren't failing, its a sign we need to think bigger.

### Quotes
- One interesting and empowering way to look at failure is to consider it a sign that you’re trying to surpass yourself. After all, you can’t fail if you’re doing something that is well within your abilities. You fail when you’re doing something that is difficult for you, in order to grow. Hence, if you aren’t failing, you’re probably not stretching yourself enough.If you’ve been going a long time without any failures, it’s time to think bigger. Not experiencing any failures is a clear sign that you’re setting your aims too low and it’s time to seek a more challenging environment or establish new, more difficult goals.
