### Summary
- Have a core idea and do it well. Even if the idea is not great, it is far better than many muddled ideas.

### Details
- An idea that is brilliant but which we do not execute is useless.
- Focus improves our idea, even if it started out mediocre

### Quotes
Communicating with one core idea that you’ve gone deep on is always better than five half-assed concepts that you taped together. And here’s the dirty secret about that one idea: it doesn’t even have to be that good! A mediocre concept that has been competently executed beats a muddled mix of otherwise brilliant ideas with no follow-through or unifying connection. Focus itself makes your work better.
