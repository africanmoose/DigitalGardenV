### Quotes
> When it comes to cleaning, water, a gift from the heavens, is the ultimate natural cleaning tool. As we must in some way contain this gift, the bucket is another tool that we must treasure.
>
> When cleaning out of doors, utilize rainwater; when cleaning indoors, use leftover bath water. It is of utmost importance that we do not waste this invaluable resource.
>
> Placing a bucket directly on the wooden floor can leave a ring of water behind. To prevent this from happening, place the bucket on top of a dust cloth. When removing the dust cloth from the floor, be especially careful so as not to spill any water.
