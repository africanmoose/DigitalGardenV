### Quotes
> Technologies, as media theorist Douglas Rushkoff says, have biases. They suggest some uses more than others. “People like to think of technologies and media as neutral and that only their use or content determines their effect,” he says. “Guns don’t kill people, after all; people kill people. But guns are much more biased toward killing people than, say, pillows.” If we fail to recognize the biases of the tools we use, our tools will, as Rushkoff says, “confound us,” much as books evidently confounded Sam Bankman-Fried.
