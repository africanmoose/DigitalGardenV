> Have you ever come out of a meeting sure of your next steps only to discover days later that your colleagues had a totally different interpretation of how you planned to move forward? While it may seem like creating “share-outs” is just glorified note-taking, these concise meeting recaps will not only give well-functioning teams a way to revisit next steps but also cement your position as the go-to person for information (which is a verified source of power). And if your team isn’t great at clarity, then you can easily become a leader who either helps guide the group toward a game plan or holds others accountable.
