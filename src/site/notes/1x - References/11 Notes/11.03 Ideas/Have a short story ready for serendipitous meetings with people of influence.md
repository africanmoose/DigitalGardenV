### Quotes
> What have you been up to? How’s that project going? What are you working on these days? The most frequent and successful visibility conversations happen during informal moments with people in your network, like when you bump into your boss’s boss in the elevator or when you’re chatting with an influential collaborator while waiting for others to join an online meeting.
> These encounters are typically quick exchanges, so you want to deliver a short but powerful story in thirty seconds or less (usually no more than two to five sentences). Give too many details and the person may start to tune out. Dump too many accomplishments in fast succession and you look like you’re trying too hard (“I did this…and this…and this…and this. Aren’t I great?”).
