### Summary
- Growth has a natural rate that is optimum for the organism

### Details
- If we grow too fast we lack the support structures and infrastructure to hold everything up 
- "It does not pay to try to get the business all at once. In the first place, you can’t get it, so a good deal of your money is thrown away. In the second place, if you did get it, the factory could not handle it. And in the third place, if you did get it, you could not hold it. A company that gets business too quickly acts just about as a boy does who gets money too quickly." - Harvey Firestone
