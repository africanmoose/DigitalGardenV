## Quote
_Do not try to save_  
_the whole world_  
_or do anything grandiose._  
_Instead, create_  
_a clearing_  
_in the dense forest_  
_of your life_  
_and wait there_  
_patiently,_  
_until the song_  
_that is your life_  
_falls into your own cupped hands_  
_and you recognize and greet it._  
_Only then will you know_  
_how to give yourself to this world_  
_so worthy of rescue._
