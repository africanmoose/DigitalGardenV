### Quotes
> don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For example, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're working on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult.\[[15](#f15n)\] [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-190c6c53ae0#f7fed156-d96a-4ee8-a06e-2652ff31c29a)

> Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit. Sometimes it's enough just to go for a walk.\[[16](#f16n)\]
