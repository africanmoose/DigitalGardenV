### Quotes
> Creating a space where you can relax and clear your mind requires adequate plant life. If your decking area or terrace faces out towards your garden, you should always keep that garden nicely kept. If it doesn’t, you should get hold of subtle plants and greenery to bring a feeling of nature to your surroundings.
