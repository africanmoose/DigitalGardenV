### Quotes
> Most people love the feeling of getting something new, but forget that it can come as easily from discovery as from consumption. A fascinating fact, a good anecdote, learning how to do something, having an experience you’ve never had before, hearing some gossip – anything that extends our picture of the universe we’re part of.
