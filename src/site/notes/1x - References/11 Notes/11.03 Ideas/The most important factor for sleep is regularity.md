### Quotes
> According to sleep psychologists, routine is probably the most important factor for sleep quality. One of the most effective ways to sabotage your sleep is to mess with your circadian rhythm by changing the times when you go to bed and wake up. A plethora of research papers have been published showing that when you disrupt your circadian rhythm, you mess with a host of bodily functions, which impacts negatively on both your sleep and your cellular health. The strong recommendation from sleep scientists is to try to go to bed at the same time every night (or very close to it) and, even more importantly it seems, get up at the same time. I know this is not good news for most people, but try to avoid those late nights and long lie-ins on the weekend. Going to bed at roughly the same time and getting up at the same time will ensure that your circadian cycle is regular, and that will dramatically improve your sleep.
