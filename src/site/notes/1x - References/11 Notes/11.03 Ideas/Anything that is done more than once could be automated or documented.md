### Quotes
> Any time you do something more than once, you should start thinking about how to never do it again. This is the mental trigger that can spur you to start documenting a process in one way or another, or at least get it on your radar. Remember that once you document a process, it can often be automated or delegated—so if you really want to stop doing some annoying part of your job, the best way to make it happen is to document it! This is a very common situation for entrepreneurs when they’re first starting out. When you’re hiring your first employee, for example, the whole process is manual. But if you were to just invest an additional 20 percent effort, you could create some quick checklists and processes for all the things you’re doing and the information you’re sending them. The next time you have to hire an employee, that process might take two hours instead of four. And over time, you can keep documenting the process until you can eventually hand it off to someone else.
