### Summary
- Super interesting book about the history of the notebook, and especially how the commonplace books used to be used, up till today. It also includes some great review of some famous notebooks

### How I discovered it
- I think it was recommended by someone on goodreads.

### How the book changed me
- I was reading this book as I was traveling through Europe and we visited a library in Madrid that had some of da Vinci's notebooks in their collection. It was amazing to see his quite incredible notebooks in person.
- I am convinced about notetaking, though currently I do my notes electronically. But this strengthened my ideas 
- I have always like da Vinci, but this took my respect for him to a whole new level. We have 15,000 pages of his notebooks preserved, and it is estimated that he must have done about 60,000 pages in his lifetime. And they are amazing in detail and information.
