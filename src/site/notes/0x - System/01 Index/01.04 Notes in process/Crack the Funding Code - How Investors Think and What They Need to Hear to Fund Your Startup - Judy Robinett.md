### Summary
- The nuts and bolts of how to apply for funding from angel investors and funders

### How I discovered it
- In view of my grant writing job, I searched for books that are related to securing funding from investors

### How the book changed me
- This book was not exactly what I thought it would be since it is talking about securing funding for a new business rather than an NGO based setup, but it was somewhat related and had some useful principles.
