### Quotes
> When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like. But a field should become _increasingly_ interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.
