### Quotes
> Mindfulness depends on the conscious separation of thought and emotion: practitioners step back from their feelings so that they can examine and name them, thereby reducing the hold that negative emotions exert on their thoughts and behaviours. Diarising one’s emotions, turning amorphous feelings into considered sentences, has always been an inherently mindful practice – predating the coinage of the phrase by hundreds of years. Ryder did it with bullet points rather than prose, but in analysing his emotional productivity in the pages of his notebook he was at once tapping into a long tradition and expressing the most millennial of mindsets. 

> Over time he discovered, as many diarists have, that this practice not only affords short-term stress relief, but also encourages personal growth and development: ‘triangulating personal insight’ as Ryder refers to it, ‘correlating your actions with your experience, recording your insights, becoming significantly more self-aware’. Another millennial trope: that of continuous evolution, self-improvement – a growth mentality.
