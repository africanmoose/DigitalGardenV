### Summary

### How I discovered it
- Sandi recommended

### How the book changed me
- I love the idea of minimalism, and it is one of my goals for this year. Shoukei has a beautiful and simple way of presenting his ideas. I have some specific ideas on how to cultivate minimalism from him, as well as some motivation since he presents it so simply

- We never use more than one bucketful of water. The water in the bucket is for washing our head and face, and brushing our teeth. Water is a blessing from nature, without which humans could not exist. We should use that blessing well, never wasting a drop. We should wash our faces with a sense of gratitude to nature.
