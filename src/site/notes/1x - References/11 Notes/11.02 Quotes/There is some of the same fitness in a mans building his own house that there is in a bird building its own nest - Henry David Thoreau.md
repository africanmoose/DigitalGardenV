## Quote
 There is some of the same fitness in a manâ€™s building his own house that there is in a bird building its own nest. Who knows if men constructed their dwellings with their own hands, and provided food for themselves and families simply and honestly enough, the poetic faculty would be universally developed, as birds universally sing when they are so engaged.
