### Quotes
> The practice of “phubbing”—or phone snubbing, constantly interrupting a conversation to check your smartphone—is similarly disruptive. In one [observational study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013916514539755), researchers watched 100 pairs of participants conversing in local coffee shops. Some naturally took out their phones and held them in their hands or placed them on the table, while others left them out of sight. At the end of the conversation, the researchers asked each person to fill out a questionnaire exploring the experience, and they found that the mere presence of the phones on the table reduced the pair’s feelings of empathy for each other, resulting in a [less fulfilling conversation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103117301737).
