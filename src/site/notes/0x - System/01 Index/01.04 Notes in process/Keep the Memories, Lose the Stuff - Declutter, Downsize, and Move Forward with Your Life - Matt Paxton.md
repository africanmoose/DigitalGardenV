### Summary
- Matt Paxton declutters for a living, and it shows from the practical approach he takes to simplifiying and deculttering.

### How I discovered it
- I have been on a minimalist drive (in my mind at least if not actually in body) so I have been actively looking for books on simplifying.

### How the book changed me
- I am getting more determined to get rid of some stuff.
