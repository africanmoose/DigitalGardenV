# Afichaye ugonjwa haponi
_A person who hides his sickness cannot be cured._

This proverb is not just true when caring for our health. It also applies to our productivity, and indeed every aspect of our lives. 

The first principle of productivity is to make our work visible. Write down, preferably in an easy to see and easily accessible place, everything that needs to be done. And I do mean everything. It doesn't matter how small it is, how irrelevant, how insignificant, how tangential it seems, it should be recorded in our system.

In fact, another Swahili proverb has a bearing: **"Mtambua ndwele ndiye mganga."** It means literally, 'the person who understands the sickness is the doctor.' Once we know exactly what the problem is, we are 90% of the way to knowing the solution. And so it is with recording everything that needs to be done. Once we can see everything clearly in one place, it is so much easier to prioritize it, to schedule it, and ultimately to actually accomplish it.

Why is it helpful to do this? What kind of information should we be recording? What are some tools we can use to record everything we need to? This chapter will be diving deep ito the first principle, and the foundation of all the other productivity principles. Make your work visible.

# Why should we make our work visible?

I first encountered this idea in David Allens' excellent book, [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/). He says, "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them." He claims that when your mind is trying to remember things, it just reduces the mental space that you might have used for actually doing the work. In this time of instant portable distraction provided by our internet enabled mobile devices, this is even more true.

I started out doing this with a pen and paper, and it made a huge difference to me. I am by nature a very forgetful person, so this was perfect for me. Over the years I have used a vast variety of methods (some of which we will discuss later), but the basic idea is always the same. Make the work visible.

Imagine driving on a multi-lane highway with a fair amount of traffic. Everyone is moving along at a good speed, and sometimes impatience might tempt us to drive close to the car ahead of us. But imagine that we slow down just a bit so that there is a good bit of space between us and the car ahead. Now we are able to see a clear section of open highway ahead of us. We can see which lane has some obstruction and move to a clear lane without barely having to change our speed. We are able to slow down and avoid a serious accident because of something unexpected lying on the road. We no longer speed up and slow down abruptly based on the cars ahead of us. Instead we move at a constant speed dictated by us and not the drivers ahead of us. We also tend to use less fuel, and arrive at our destination more relaxed and less stressed.

[picture here?]

This is exactly the same as with planning our lives. Writing everything that we need to do down allows us to see ahead clearly. Of course it takes a bit of time to do this, similar to how we might have to slow down initially in traffic to give ourselves the space to see. But the advantages are myriad. We can now see farther ahead. We can now choose our work and how much time we devote to it based on what we want, rather than responding to outside forces. We are no longer speeding up and slowing down frantically as forgotten deadlines suddenly come upon us. Our work now progresses at a smooth and regular pace. We are more relaxed and less stressed because we trust our system, and know that we have not forgotten anything. And we avoid the crazy accident because we see it way in advance and adjust accordingly in advance.

As we record what needs to be done, as well as what we actually do, a few things start to become clear to us. One important thing is our estimation of how long tasks take becomes more accurate. How often do we come to the end of a day in which we are terribly busy, but cannot remember what we actually accomplished? Certain tasks take longer than we imagine: answering emails, random requests from others and administrative tasks often fall into this category. We might call this 'invisible work.' Once we know how long it takes we are able to manage and schedule it as we do with our other work.

A final advantage of making things visible has to do with looking back and reviewing. We will be discussing this in more detail later on, but the basic idea is this: As we measure and record things we have done, we will be astounded at how much we have learned, how much we have grown and how much we have actually accomplished. Our brains are notoriously bad at remembering how things were in the past (sometimes they even fabricate memories of things that did not happen!), so keeping a record allows us to clearly see our progress. This helps us by encouraging us, as well as showing us where to focus our efforts in future endeavors.

# What kind of information should we be recording?

Likely we want to be more productive in our work environment. So we are going to start with work related information. The first and most obvious thing is basically our to do list. This typically ranges from 'send an email to remind Mike in accounts to follow through with that invoice' to more long range tasks such as 'develop marketing campaign for next years sales.' No matter how big or small, record all the tasks that need to be done. At this point don't worry about organizing them or prioritizing them, we want to just get them down on paper (or electronically.)

Next up is our professional goals. These tend to be long-term and might include goals for personal learning, for progressing our careers, or perhaps monetary goals. Just like our to do list, these goals may also involve short term goals as well. 

Just as we have professional work and goals, we also have personal goals and work. At some point we may wish to separate these, but for now our main objective is to get it all done. So go ahead and write down personal work that needs to be done. This might be related to our personal finances, our personal development, hobbies that we have always wanted to pursue, trips we want to make. Likely we have things we have always wanted to do for and with our family and friends. Maybe we have spiritual growth goals, or jobs that we need to do around our home or on our vehicle or clothing. The principle is to get it out of our heads and onto our recording system.

Closely related to our to do lists and our plans and goals, but perhaps in a different category is logging or recording what we are currently doing. Human memory is pretty much rubbish and cannot be trusted. The importance of logging can be illustrated by an example. How often does it happen to us that we doom scroll a half hour every now and then. Likely this will not bother us too much. But imagine if we actually log the time that we spend doom scrolling on social media and discover that we actually spend two hours a day, every day on social media? Just seeing this rather shocking statistic may actually prompt us to change without even specifically making it a goal. Incidentally, my example is based on the the worldwide average time humans spend online every day: a little over two hours a day, which is food for thought.

Basically any behavior or activity that we want to change should be monitored and recorded. For example, if we want to use our time more productively, we need to keep a basic log of how we use our time. If we want to improve how we spend our money, we need to keep track of it. If we want to change a habit, whether it be alcohol intake, waking up early, eating more healthy, we need to record what we are doing.

In summary, what should we record? Basically we should record everything that matters to us. Our goals, our work to do, our plans, how we use our time, whether it be long term or short term, everything should go into our recording bucket.

# What are some tools we can use to record everything we need to?

A theme that we will keep coming back to is that you should use the tool that works for you. I suggest trying a few different ones that appeal to you, and then stick with the one that suits your lifestyle and personality best. A poor tool that you use consistently is way better than an excellent tool that you never use. Ideally our tool will be simple and require minimal effort to use.

As always, the first tools I will mention are traditional non-electronic tools. There is a reason that these tools have persisted through the centuries: they actually work.

Paper is an incredible invention: It's cheap, easily personalized, can function as a note-taking center, sketch book, calendar and to do list without needing to purchase any higher tier level to unlock these functions. Paper doesn't require recharging, is recycleable, portable and flexible. It is also capabal of being organized into highly sophisticated and complex systems.

I always suggest starting with paper, since it will inform which electronic tool you will end up using.

Electronic tools have to be divided by the kind of information that we are saving in them. I do not intend to give a lot of detail here since the landscape is always changing, but perhaps to give you a few ideas of what you could try.

**For Notes** The basic tool here would be a simple text editor such as notepad that can edit text files. There are various online versions such as Simplenote, Apple Notes, Google Keep, Evernote and Microsoft Onenote.

**For Dates and Time** Any simple calendar app here would work. Google Calendar, Microsoft Calendar, Apple Calendar and Calendar.com

**For Job lists** There are lots of options here, from relatively simple lists which you could keep in a text file (see the 'for notes' section), to highly advanced and complex planning tools. A few options to look at are Google Tasks, Microsoft Outlook tasks, Todoist, Asana, Redmine, ClickUp. The list here is really endless.

In each of these cases, it is more important to have a tool than to have the exact perfect tool. Once you start using it, you will identify limitations and be able to naturally progress to a tool that has the capability you need. Owning the most expensive pair of sneakers does not make us into a marathon runner.


# My personal tools

A few principles I try to keep for my personal tools: I like them to be open source, or at least have a free tier. I like them to be simple. I am more interested in function than form, but if a tool has function and then is also pretty it shoots to the top of the list. I also like it if my data can be stored locally, or at least be easily ported into another tool should I decide to change in the future.

## Note taking tools

I use two different tools here. 

**Simplenote** I use this super simple and easy to use app as a temporary location where I randomly post or write notes. It has an app for both android and apple devices, and is also available online. It basically stores text files, which can be understood by any computer or device. At the end of the day, or sometimes a few days, I will download everything into my long-term storage tool: 

**Obsidian** This is a powerful app for my long term note-taking. It is free. Even though the app itself is proprietary, it stores my notes in plain text files on my computer, which I can subsequently back up into my dropbox account or on offline storage. It allows for keeping notes in different folders, and also allows you to link from one note to another. And it allows for lots of different plugins that allow for automation for repetitive tasks such as creating a daily log from a template. It also allows me to automatically publish selected notes online. You can look at my notes here [africanmoose.netlify.com](https://africanmoose.netlify.com) to get an idea of what kind of things I keep in my notes.

As a bonus, both Simplenote and Obsidian are pretty.

## Calendar tools

I basically use **Google Calendar** for my calendar appointments. It allows for recurring appointments, and for multiple shared calendars with my significant other, family and friends. I generally try to color code my appointments. Sharing a calendar with my wife was a game changer for planning and scheduling, and I cannot recommend it enough. Though I don't often hit it exactly right, but I try to plan out every part of my day. More on this in a future chapter though!

I also subscribe to a couple of other publicly available calendars, for example my favorite football club that automatically inserts all the club games into my calendar.

![Pasted image 20240407133648.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020240407133648.png)

For work I use **Microsoft Outlook**, though I wish I could combine everything onto one calendar. I will keep working on this, maybe I can find a thirdy party automation that will do this.

## To do list

All my work to be done goes into **Asana**. This is a tool that allows me to see a visual representation of my work. It allows me to use a Kanban board which makes tasks even more visual by giving each task a little box (like a post it note), and move them around towards completion in a more visual way. It also allows me to have long range huge projects, but only the tasks I need to focus on for that particular week visible on my Kanban board. You can see a sample below.

![Pasted image 20240407134220.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020240407134220.png)

It is an online tool, and free for a basic plan. There are plenty of other online tools that allow similar functionality. One day for a challenge I intend to move this to an open source solution called Redmine that offers similar functionality, though I will have to install my own server to do this.
