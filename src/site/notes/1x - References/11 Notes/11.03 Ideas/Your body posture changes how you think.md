> In a mind-blowing study, researchers in 2017 found that the way you hold your body changes the way you think. Participants were asked to complete creative tasks in different body postures. When participants sat in an open posture, they were significantly more creative! Bottom line: Closed body posture makes us less creative and less open-minded.

> Highlight: When you need to spark ideas. Want to be more creative, open-minded, imaginative? Uncross your arms. Want others to be more creative, open-minded, or imaginative? Encourage them to uncross theirs.
