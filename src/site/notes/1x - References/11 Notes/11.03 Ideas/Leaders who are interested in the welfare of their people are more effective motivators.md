### Quotes
>In order to move with velocity, Napoleon also needed to get others to move at the same pace. He was very involved in the lives and welfare of his troops, partly to inspire them to push themselves to meet the tempo he wanted to move at. He employed various tactics to achieve this. First, “his treatment of the troops under his command had been designed from the start not only to make them more effective as fighting men, but also to turn them into his men.”6 By “giving them victory and talking to the men as equals,” 7 he boosted their self-esteem by making them feel they were achieving what other men and armies could not. They admired Napoleon and completely bought into his vision. Velocity became a group goal. They all wanted to move quickly, seeing it as integral to victory.
