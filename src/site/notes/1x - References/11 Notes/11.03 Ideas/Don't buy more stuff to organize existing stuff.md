### Summary
- When trying to clean up, it is tempting to buy organizing supplies to organize our existing stuff. Don't do it!

### Details

### Quotes
> I understood the impulse. It was clear what he was getting at, although I don’t think he knew it—he wanted to buy organizing supplies as a way to avoid the scary feeling of starting to declutter. But I told him that he didn’t need to buy a bunch of bins and fancy labeling systems. More important, he shouldn’t! Getting more stuff is a particularly bad way to have less stuff. Indeed, for many people, too much consumption is what got us into our cluttered situation in the first place.
