### Summary
- The law of the minimum states that the yield of a crop will be dictated by the essential nutrient available at the lowest level
- In other words, the limiting factor will be the essential nutrient which is least, and you cant fix it by adding more of another nutrient

### Details
- the law was formulated in the 1820s by botanist Carol Spregnel
- It is not what is available that matters, it is what is required by teh plant
- E.g. you can't make up for lack of sleep with more food or more time

### Quotes
> The Law of the Minimum states that the yield of a crop will always be dictated by the essential nutrient that is available at the lowest level. No matter how abundant the other essential nutrients are, being deficient in one will always limit the cropâ€™s growth. If the level of that nutrient is increased, another will become the limiting factor. One way to envision this is as a bucket with a hole through which water leaks out. The bucket cannot fill to the brim as a result. The deficient nutrient is the hole in the bucket.

> The law comes from botanist Carol Spregnel, who formulated it in the 1820s. Biochemist Justus von Liebig later popularized the concept. It is an important concept for farmers to understand. When the price of a particular fertilizer increases, some farmers are tempted to use less of it and more of cheaper nutrients. But this stunts the growth of their crops, as the other nutrients do not compensate for the deficient one.

>It is not necessarily what is available that matters. What is scarce can be paramount too. We can see this in our own lives as well. If you skip on sleep to have more time, tiredness then becomes the limiting factor to your productivity, not time.
