### Summary
- The nuts and bolts of how to apply for funding from angel investors and funders

### How I discovered it
- In view of my grant writing job, I searched for books that are related to securing funding from investors

### How the book changed me
- This book was not exactly what I thought it would be since it is talking about securing funding for a new business rather than an NGO based setup, but it was somewhat related and had some useful principles. 
- I am now starting to keep a networking strategy

### Details
- The top way that investors choose a good deal is from referrals from people they know, like and trust
- [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.03 Ideas/Have a networking strategy\|Have a networking strategy]] This is my main valuable takeaway from this book, with some very practical ways to create and develop a good professional network.
