### Quotes
> Communication is like the oxygen of a business. If a team isn’t communicating well, it’s nearly impossible to succeed. Without good communication, everything slows down: errors occur, projects take longer to complete, culture deteriorates, and work becomes frustrating. Therefore, improving communication is one of the quickest and most cost-effective ways to improve the operations of any business, as it makes everything easier. Great communication will assist with delegation, create alignment, increase awareness, and improve productivity. At Leverage, we typically find that just optimizing email usage can save well over two hours per week per person. And this is not rocket science— when we work with teams, we’re able to train them on how to regain control of their inbox and maintain it within just a few sessions. We’ve done this with people who have had tens of thousands of unread emails in their inbox, so if you’re reading this and thinking that your thirty-one thousand unread emails is too difficult to deal with, think again.
