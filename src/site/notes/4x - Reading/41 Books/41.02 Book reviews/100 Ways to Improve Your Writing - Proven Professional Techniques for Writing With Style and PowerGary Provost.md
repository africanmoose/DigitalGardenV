### Summary
- A general guide to writing - everything from grammar to how to develop a story line. This is a really excellent guide to good writing. It is also written in a witty and entertaining way, making it a good read

### How the book changed me
- I loved the parts about how to simplify my writing, and how to cut out anything that does not contribute to the story. I intend to apply this.
