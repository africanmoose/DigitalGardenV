## Quote
I would offer that nothing in your leadership tool kit is as valuable as hard work. Hard work creates opportunities. Hard work endears you to your workforce. Hard work increases your knowledge, your understanding, your empathy, and your insights. Hard work will overcome your shortfalls in talent. And when you stumble as a leader, nothing repairs the damage as quickly as hard work.
