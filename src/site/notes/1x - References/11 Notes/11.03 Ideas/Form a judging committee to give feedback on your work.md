### Summary
- Form a judging committee for a specific project. Ask them to rate the writing on a scale of 1-10. then ask what I need to do to get closer to a 10.

### Details
- Asking for a rating is better than asking for feedback, no one ever gives a 10. so there will always be some feedback

### Quotes
For every project that matters to me, I’ve had judging committees for
over a decade now. They’re not permanent structures; they’re temporary scaffolding. I think of them as pop-up workshops. For each project, I pull together a different mix of five to seven insiders and outsiders with complementary skills. The group bands, disbands, and morphs as relevant. My first request isn’t for feedback or advice. It’s for a score. I ask the
judges to independently rate my work on a scale from 0 to 10. No one ever says 10. Then I ask how I can get closer to 10.
