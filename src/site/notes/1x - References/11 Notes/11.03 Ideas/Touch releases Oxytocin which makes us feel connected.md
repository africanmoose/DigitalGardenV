### Quotes
> The moment we touch someone or someone touches us, our chemistry changes. Touch creates the potent chemical oxytocin. As we have learned, oxytocin plays a complicated role in our body, but in interactions it increases trust, warmth, and rapport. Even small touches—a high five, a fist bump, or a pat on the back—produce oxytocin and encourage trust.

> Oxytocin is the chemical of WOW. It feels like the warm and fuzzies. Ever been with someone and felt like you just clicked? That’s the feeling of oxytocin

> Study after study shows that a subtle touch increases trust in all kinds of relationships, from social to romantic to professional. Touch has also been shown to make us feel closer to and more positive about the toucher, whether that person is a friend, a family member, a colleague, a stranger, or even a basketball teammate. When you trust your teammates, you play better, you pass more, you have faith that everyone is doing their job well.
