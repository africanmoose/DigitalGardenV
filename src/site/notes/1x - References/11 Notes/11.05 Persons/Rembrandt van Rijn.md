### References
> Look at how Rembrandt rendered faces. When you are in the presence of a Rembrandt portrait, you’re seeing the warts and wounds of the subject, but you’re also peering into their depths, seeing their inner dignity, the immeasurable complexity of their inner lives. The novelist Frederick Buechner observed that not all the faces Rembrandt painted were remarkable. Sometimes the subject is just an old man or an elderly lady we wouldn’t look at twice if we passed them on the street. But even the plainest faces “are so remarkably seen by Rembrandt that we are jolted into seeing them remarkably.”
