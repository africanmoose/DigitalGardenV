### Quotes
> With few exceptions, you wouldnâ€™t ignore a friend for months or years and then expect a favor, right? The same goes for professional contacts. But when work and life get busy and you fall out of touch, it can feel awkward to reach out again. Since networking is a continuous process rather than a one-time event, it helps to create a system to check in with your network and keep your connections alive.
