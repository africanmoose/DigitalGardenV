## Quote
"Whether you are an adult or child, your first attempts will often seem unimportant or foolish.

- The open mic night at a nearly empty bar.
- The early blog posts that get ignored.
- The dance recital on a little stage.

Early attempts are easy to dismiss because they don't seem to amount to much. But you have to do the low stakes stuff to prepare for the high stakes stuff. They are the building blocks of confidence, and that's an enormous thing."
