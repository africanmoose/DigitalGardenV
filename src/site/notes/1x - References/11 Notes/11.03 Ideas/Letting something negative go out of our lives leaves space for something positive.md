### Quotes
> One lesson I’ve learned countless times over the years is that whenever you let go of something negative in your life, you make room for something positive. Releasing the toxic relationship with Chris that had once gripped me opened my eyes to the fact that I could, in fact, go back to school and pursue some of my dreams. Leaving my job in the public sector gave me the opportunity to see that I could write for a living. Even doing something as simple as choosing not to finish a book I didn’t like gave me more time to read books I loved. And putting less energy into the friendships with people who didn’t understand me gave me more energy to put into the friendships with people who did.

> 2011 was that it forced me to free up room in my budget, which included canceling my cable. I’ve never gone back on that decision, and I can’t imagine I ever will. Not having cable freed up time that I used to complete my degree, start my blog, change careers, and start freelancing on the side. And even with all of that, I also managed to get outside, go hiking with friends, and spend more time with the people I loved. I was never “too busy.” All I had done in the past was choose what I wanted to be busy doing. I had prioritized television over people and, in turn, lost precious time with them. I didn’t want to lose another minute, so I decided it was time to finally ask my parents for the help they had once offered.
