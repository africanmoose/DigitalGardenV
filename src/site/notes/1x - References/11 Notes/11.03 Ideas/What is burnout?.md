### Quotes
But over the next few minutes, I listened as my mum (a psychiatrist) explained that burnout isn’t just a thing that happens to overworked people in stressful jobs. It can happen to anyone when work stops feeling meaningful, enjoyable or manageable. When you’re burned out, you feel overwhelmed and undermotivated. You feel like you can’t keep up the pace, no matter how hard you try. After hanging up, I decided to take her advice for once and find
out more. The previous year, I discovered, the World Health Organization (WHO) had redefined burnout. Burnout was not just a stress syndrome bound up with working yourself too hard. It was much more everyday than that. According to the WHO definition, burnout is an ‘occupational phenomenon’, characterised by ‘feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job; and reduced professional efficacy’. And crucially, it isn’t related to the number of hours you’re working – it’s about how you feel.
