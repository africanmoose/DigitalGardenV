### Quotes
> Ogden stresses that it is important to realise that we have to *spend* time to gain the benefits, however. “Find the time and space to do the things that you’re going to remember,” she advises. “And spend time reminiscing about good things that have happened to you. Because the more we keep these memories alive, the more we’re likely to feel like the year was longer.” Keeping a diary or replacing stressful “to-do” lists with “I did” lists could help with this, she argues.
