- When you lock eyes with someone, Oxytocin is produced which is a hormone that makes us feel bonded and makes us feel trust
- The more mutual gazing, the more brain waves sync up 
- Gaze tells us what someone is interested in
- Gaze tells us what a person is thinking since we are able to look at their facial clues

### Quotes
> Every time you lock eyes with someone, you both produce an important hormone for trust called oxytocin. Oxytocin has a number of incredible effects on our body—it helps us feel bonded and builds trust. But its most important effect is not as well known.

> They found the greater the amount of mutual gazing, the more participants’ brain waves synced up. Want someone to get on the same page as you? Gaze can literally help you sync up mentally

> Gaze is an attention cue. We look to gaze to see who or what someone is paying attention to. Are they looking at us? Great, that makes us feel important. In conversation, we pay attention to gaze direction to know whose turn it is to talk.

> Gaze with intent. Don’t just gaze, search. Looking for emotions gives your eye contact direction and purpose. When you’re speaking with someone, search their face for clues about how they’re feeling and what they’re thinking. This is highly competent

> Gaze for oxytocin. Avoid dead eyes and lifeless eye contact. Instead, try looking for eye locks. This is a moment where you and a conversation partner lock eyes—and it can be brief! Lock eyes when you agree, when you both laugh at the same time, or when you’re intensely paying attention. This is a great way to produce oxytocin and reduces the pressure of having to make eye contact all the time. A few great eye locks will give you all the oxytocin you need. And that’s a great way to add more warmth.
