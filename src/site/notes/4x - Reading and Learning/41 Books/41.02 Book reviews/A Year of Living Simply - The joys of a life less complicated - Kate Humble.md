### Summary
- Interesting book about a year of living a 'simpler' life though she clearly has enough assets to do this without hassle.

### How I discovered it
- I have been trying to read books on minimalism and simplification.

### How the book changed me
- I am really trying to simplify my life more - this gave me some more ideas and motivation. I think the most interesting thing out of this was learning about earthship houses.
