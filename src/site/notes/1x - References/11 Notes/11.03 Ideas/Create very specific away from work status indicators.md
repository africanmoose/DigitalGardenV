### Summary
- Create very specific away from work status indicators

### Details
- 'compiling august budget' is more effective than 'away till 3pm ' because our colleagues are able to adjust their expectations accordingly (or interrupt if it is a genuinely important thing)

### Quotes
> • Step up your status updates. Swap generic status indicators like “Available” or “Do Not Disturb” for customized statuses that provide more information. For example: “Lunch until 1pm,” “Offline for the day—will check messages at 8am tomorrow,” or “Compiling the January numbers.” Colleagues can then adjust their expectations accordingly and are more likely to respect your boundaries when they understand what you’re working on and when you’ll be free.
