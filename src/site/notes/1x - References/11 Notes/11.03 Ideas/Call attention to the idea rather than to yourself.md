### Quotes
> Introverts in particular struggle with vocal variety because it calls attention to yourself. Here’s a reframe: You’ve worked hard to accumulate your knowledge, skills, and ideas. You’re not calling attention to yourself; you’re calling attention to your ideas. Vocal variety does more than just help you sound more interesting. It actually helps people be more interested in what you have to say. It’s a hook that benefits them and you
