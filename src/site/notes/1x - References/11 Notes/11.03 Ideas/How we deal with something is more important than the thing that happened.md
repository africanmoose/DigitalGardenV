### Summary
- Objectively, events may be much worse or not as bad as we think. However, what matters is how we feel subjectively about those events.

### Details
- if we want to know someone, we need to understand the subjective aspect of why they do what they do, rather than what actually happened.

### Quotes
> As the Yale psychologist Marc Brackett puts it, “Well-being depends less on objective events than on how those events are perceived, dealt with, and shared with others.” This subjective layer is what we want to focus on in our quest to know other people. The crucial question is not “What happened to this person?” or “What are the items on their résumé?” Instead, we should ask: “How does this person interpret what happened? How does this person see things? How do they construct their reality?” This is what we really want to know if we want to understand another person.
