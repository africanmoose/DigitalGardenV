Chindogu is the Japanese art of eccentric invention. Often causing more problems than they solve, Chindogu ultimately serve no real purpose. Neither useful nor useless, they are therefore “unuseless” inventions, similar to how “undead” means not dead but also not alive.
Coined by Kenji Kawakami in the 1980s, Chindogu is a sort of portmanteau that roughly translates to something like “weird or curious tool or device.” Chindogu merges the bizarre absurdity of a mad scientist with the genius and innovation of an aspiring armchair inventor.
While seemingly chaotic and unstructured, Chindogu must adhere to “The Ten Tenets of Chindogu” as defined by the International Chindogu Society:
1. Not Really: A Chindogu cannot be for real use. If it is actually helpful then it is not a Chindogu.
2. Exist-essential: A Chindogu must be created. It can’t just exist on paper. If it doesn’t exist, then the world will never really know that it is neither useful nor useless.
3. Anarchic: Chindogu is free to be what it needs to be and is broken free from the chains of usefulness.


4. Universally Unuseless: Chindogu are tools for everyday life. Everyone must recognize the uselessness.
5. Not for Sale: Chindogu are not for sale, even as a joke.
6. Stop Trying to Be Funny: Humor must not be the sole reason for creating a Chindogu.
7. Propaganda … Not: Chindogu are innocent and are made with the best intention.
8. Keep It Clean: Chindogu are never taboo. They must not represent cheap sexual innuendo, vulgar humor, or sick jokes.
9. Don’t Get Greedy: Chindogu are offerings to the rest of the world and cannot be patented, copyrighted, or otherwise privately owned.
10. Chindogu for All: Chindogu are without prejudice. All should have a free and equal chance to enjoy each and every Chindogu.
