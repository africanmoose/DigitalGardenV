### Summary
- Absorptive capacity is the ability to recognize, value, assimilate new information

### Details
- It is dependent on how we acquire information: being proactive in seeking new knowledge skills and perspectives.

### Quotes
Sponginess was the first thing that stood out to me about Mellody too. I first met her a decade ago, when I was invited to give a presentation on my research to a group of VIPs. When I walked into the room, I recognized multiple Oscar-winning filmmakers and tech billionaires. It was Mellody who asked the most questions—and she was the only one to take notes. When it came to seeking and soaking up information, she was in a league of her own. Her engagement was more than curiosity: she had unusual levels of what social scientists call absorptive capacity. Absorptive capacity is the ability to recognize, value, assimilate, and
apply new information. It hinges on two key habits. The first is how you acquire information: Do you react to what enters your field of vision, or are you proactive in seeking new knowledge, skills, and perspectives? The second is the goal you’re pursuing when you filter information: Do you focus on feeding your ego or fueling your growth? Being reactive and ego driven is a surefire way to short-circuit learning. It traps people in a protective bubble. They limit their access to new information and reject any input that threatens their image. Their thin skin leaves them with thick skulls.
