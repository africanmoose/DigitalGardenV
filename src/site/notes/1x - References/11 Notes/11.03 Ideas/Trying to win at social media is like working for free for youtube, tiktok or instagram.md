### Quotes
> A friend asked about his niece’s career path. She’s spending hours every day on TikTok, developing videos and hoping to build a following.
> She might not realize it, but she is working for TikTok without getting hired or paid to do so. She guesses at what the system wants and strives to deliver it.
> Someone is going to win the lottery, but it’s probably not going to be her.
> When we sign up to feed the system, we’re joining in with others who are offering a similar product or service. Plenty of alternatives with little chance to build a unique asset, which means that it’s unlikely you’ll be fairly compensated.
> Feeding the system can be fun and it feels safe, which is why so many people do it.
