### Summary
- When racing, focus on where you want to go. If you look at the sides or at the opponent, you will crash.
- Likewise in life, focus on long term goals not day to day situations

### Details
- When disasters occur, we will focus on taking the next step instead of worrying about the unalterably past
- For example, when we have a relapse trying to change a habit, it is an oportunity to examine why we back tracked and fix that aspect

### Quotes
In racing, they say that your car goes where your eyes go. The driver who cannot tear his eyes away from the wall as he spins out of control will meet that wall; the driver who looks down the track as he feels his tires break free will regain control of his vehicle.—Garth Stein228When you face hardships and feel like you’re about to crash, heed the advice of racing drivers: look at where you want your car to go, not at the wall you want to avoid hitting.In practical terms, this means focusing on taking the next step to solve the difficult situation instead of busying your mind with worrying about what will happen if you don’t manage to succeed. Doing the latter is not only a waste of energy, it also actively works against you by convincing your brain that the failure is inevitable, thereby making it less likely that you’ll avoid

When everything goes wrong, you might be tempted to think that everything is already lost. You’ve already made a mistake, you can’t go past the obstacles, the negative circumstances got the best of you.There’s no denying the fact that chaos doesn’t make it easy to think logically. However, if you exert some willpower and force yourself to examine the situation without emotions clouding your judgment, you might discover new opportunities in the middle of chaos.

For example, if you’re on a diet and somehow one cheat meal turned into a week-long binge, you can conclude that everything is lost and give up. It’s the easy choice, but as we’ve already discussed on many occasions, easy choices are rarely the right ones.The chaos that has ensued in your diet offers opportunities. For example, you can now jot down the thoughts you have when you gorge on unhealthy food after a long period of going without it. What makes you eat it? What’s the underlying motive? How can you satisfy your need for junk food without actually eating
