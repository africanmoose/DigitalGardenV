## What is this site for?

- A digital garden is like a physical garden, but for your mind. You collect ideas like so many seeds, you tend them by feeding them on related knowledge, and thoughts sprout like new fruits. It requires consistency and patience, but each interaction with your garden is unique
- Many of the ideas written here are not quite fully formed, but in the spirit of working with the door open, I am publishing them here
- A place to share interesting quotes, book reviews, music I like and any other random information
- A place to share interesting workflows, productivity tools and ideas on how to work
- I update this site usually a few times a week, so feel free to come back often, or use the RSS feed at the bottom of the page
