### Quotes
> Other neurological researchers have shown that paper notebooks make particularly effective learning tools, with an edge over their digital counterparts. Multiple studies have found that students who take lecture notes on laptops donâ€™t learn as well as those who write with pen and paper. This is partly due to the distracting temptations offered by the internet, and partly because typing encourages verbatim note-taking, rather than paraphrasing, summarising and concept mapping, which are much more effective ways at encoding new information in the memory.

> In 2021, a Japanese study compared how effectively we take (non-academic) notes on paper, a phone, or a tablet. Pen and paper proved the most efficient by far: not only did subjects complete the note-taking task more quickly, they later had much better recall of the details. This study also used MRI scanning to discover that the hippocampi, precunei, visual cortices, and language-related frontal regions of the brain were all much more active in the notebook users.
