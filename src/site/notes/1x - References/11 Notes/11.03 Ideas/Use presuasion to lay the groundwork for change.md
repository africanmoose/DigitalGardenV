### Quotes
> You don’t want your boss or manager to be hearing about your project for the first time when you’re trying to get it approved. “Change makes people nervous,” explains Melody. “You’re likely to get immediate pushback if you haven’t tested the waters for your idea.” 

> That’s why she recommends using a technique called pre-suasion, a term coined by psychologist [Robert Cialdini](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Pre-Suasion/Robert-Cialdini/9781501109805). “This isn’t about manipulation or planting an idea in someone’s head,” she says. “The goal is to lay the groundwork so when you make a request to move forward, it feels like a natural next step.” 

>Here’s how pre-suasion could sound in practice: 

>- Ask for feedback on how your organization is currently addressing (or not addressing) the problem, _before_ bringing up your new solution
>- Build urgency by talking about results competitors have created in the area you’re focused on, or why now might be the right time to act
>- Mention that you’ve been researching potential solutions or strategies, even before you have something concrete to share
