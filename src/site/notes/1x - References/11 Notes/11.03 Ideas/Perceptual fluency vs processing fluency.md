### Quotes
When psychologists and neuroscientists talk about fluency, they are referring to a suite of experiences that we’ll distill down to two major buckets, perceptual fluency and processing fluency:
• Perceptual fluency—How easily do we notice things? 
• Processing fluency—How easily do we understand things?
An incredible body of evidence across a wide range of factors points to the same result: we are naturally biased toward things that are easier to perceive and process. When our experience with a message or concept is more fluent, we’re more likely to believe it, trust it, prefer it, and choose it.
