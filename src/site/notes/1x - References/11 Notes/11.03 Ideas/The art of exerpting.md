### Quotes
> Pliny the Younger, fourteen hundred years earlier, had written that his uncle, Pliny the Elder, ‘never read without taking extracts, and used to say that there never was a book so bad that it was not good in some passage or another’. This constant note-taking had left the younger Pliny with a legacy of 160 commentarios ‘written on both sides of the scrolls, and in a very small handwriting’. Literate Romans referred to this skill as the ars excerpendi, the art of excerpting, but with the collapse in written culture that followed the fall of Rome, it had more or less vanished. A book was usually copied at length or not at all, and few scholars had the luxury of their own private codex to write in.

> The selection of a passage to excerpt required the exercise of judgement, a benefit summarised by Justus Lipsius, another Dutch scholar, in the Latin tag Non colligo, sed seligo (‘I don’t collect, I select’). Selecting the appropriate common place (or locus, under a headword) for a given excerpt demanded still deeper engagement with its ideas, and once an excerpt was in place, juxtaposition with what had already been written tended to generate further shades of meaning. The physical labour of copying by hand also fixed the quotation more firmly in the mind. As yet another scholarly excerpter, the Jesuit Jeremias Drexel, put it, Notae propriae, notae optimae: ‘your own notes are the best notes’. Finally, the well-arranged common-place functioned as a kind of externalised memory, which, as historian Ann Blair notes, ‘liberated the reader from the task of memorising the selected passages’. This in turn ‘freed up mental capacity for... reasoning and reflection’ and was particularly useful in an age when the rate of arrival of new books far outstripped anyone’s ability to master their contents.
