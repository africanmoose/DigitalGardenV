### Summary
- Understanding the world cannot be done by reading sound bites (twitter, etc), but requires time and effort to comprehend

### Details
- Reading a book is a good way to try and comprehend something since it requires focus on one subject for an extended period of time

### Quotes
> Whether people immediately agree with you is no marker of whether what you are saying is true or right – you have to think for yourself. Reality can only be understood sensibly by adopting the opposite messages to Twitter. The world is complex and requires steady focus to be understood; it needs to be thought about and comprehended slowly; and most important truths will be unpopular when they are first articulated. I realised that the times in my own life when I’ve been most successful on Twitter – in terms of followers and retweets – are the times when I have been least useful as a human being: when I’ve been attentiondeprived, simplistic, vituperative. Of course there are occasional nuggets of insight on the site – but if this becomes your dominant mode of absorbing information, I believe the quality of your thinking will rapidly degrade

> Before the words convey their specific meaning, the medium of the book tells us several things. Firstly, life is complex, and if you want to understand it, you have to set aside a fair bit of time to think deeply about it. You need to slow down. Secondly, there is a value in leaving behind your other concerns and narrowing down your attention to one thing, sentence after sentence, page after page. Thirdly, it is worth thinking deeply about how other people live and how their minds work. They have complex inner lives just like you.
