### Summary
- Strongly focused on business strategy

### How I discovered it
- I always enjoy Seth Godins work, though this particular book seemed a bit longer than usual

### How the book changed me
- This book has a large collection of ideas that are not necessarily related to each other. But there are a number that i intend to make use of.
